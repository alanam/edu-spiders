We will conclude the course by considering the current stage of television- TV III- in which the era of ""on demand"" has further destabilized traditional notions of content, audiences, producers, scheduling and technologies.  In addition to tracing this development historically and thematically, we will confront it critically, analyzing the connections between power and money in the medium of television.",Understanding Television,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,COM FT 303

Science has allowed us to understand our physical place in the universe as well as our origin as a species on Earth. Science in our globalized modern world can seem increasingly complex, but most scientific understandings are based on relatively few conceptual paradigms or accepted ideas. Many of these major paradigms will be covered in this course, including the origin of life, the molecular and cellular theories of life, human origins, genetics, evolutionary theory and biodiversity. The underlying pedagogy of the course is to examine what we know about an accepted paradigm, how we know these scientific facts and theories, and what are the contemporary applications of the accepted paradigms. The course also provides the primary scientific tools required to explore scientific, ethical and sociological concerns that arise from our understanding of the origin, evolution and diversity of life including that of our own species.

," Today, it seems that trauma is everywhere. It haunts soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.  It afflicts the survivors of 9/11 and witnesses to the Boston Marathon bombings.  It colors the lives of victims in the rape epidemic still unfolding on college campuses.  It shapes the way we talk about race after the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice.  It is a lens through which we look at genocides past and present.  And it provides new ways to read literature, view art, and watch television and film.   This course is a co-taught, interdisciplinary seminar that explores the many ways that psychological trauma manifests itself in the contemporary world.

,"The association between France and fine cuisine seems so ""natural.""  French society  and history are intertwined with the culinary, and have been since the court society of  the Old Regime.  After the French Revolution, French cuisine became a truly modern  affair in the public sphere.  The invention of the restaurant, the practice of  gastronomy, a literature of food, and strong links between French cuisine and national  identity all came together in the 19th century.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, French  food, featuring both haute cuisine and regional culinary specialties, was widely  considered the world's best. In the 20th century, the culinary allure of France  continued to fascinate people all over the world.

With war, terrorism, global climate change, geological disruptions, and other threats, humans tend to feel more vulnerable, more insecure, and to seek deeper understandings of themselves and their world. Accordingly, issues such as abortion, capital punishment, and stem-cell research take on new meanings as morality evolves with culture. How do we develop a moral understanding of what is appropriate behavior for ourselves and others around us? Is morality carved in stone or is it subject to change, depending upon life experience, religion, secular and social orientation, and other factors?

,"What can food tell us about human culture and social organization? Food offers us many opportunities to explore the ways in which humans go about their daily lives from breaking bread at the family table, haggling over the price of meat at the market to worrying about having enough to eat. Food can also tell us about larger social organizations and global interconnections through products like Spam that are traded around the globe and the ways in which a fruit like the tomato transformed the culinary culture of European nations. In this course we will consider how the Anthropology of Food has developed as a subfield of Cultural Anthropology. We will also look at the various methodologies and theoretical frameworks used by anthropologists to study food and culture. 4 cr.",Anthropology of Food,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,MET ML 641

,"The association between France and fine cuisine seems so ""natural.""  French society  and history are intertwined with the culinary, and have been since the court society of  the Old Regime.  After the French Revolution, French cuisine became a truly modern  affair in the public sphere.  The invention of the restaurant, the practice of  gastronomy, a literature of food, and strong links between French cuisine and national  identity all came together in the 19th century.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, French  food, featuring both haute cuisine and regional culinary specialties, was widely  considered the world's best. In the 20th century, the culinary allure of France  continued to fascinate people all over the world.  It is still said today, enviously, that  the French really know how to appreciate good food and wine ""la bonne chÃ¨re"" in  their daily lives.  This course looks at how the history of French culinary culture  evolved in the particular way that it did. The course is organized largely  chronologically, but not entirely, as some of the readings weave issues of different  times periods thematically.

Contemporary examples will allow students to think of how other voices and perspectives (gender, ethnic, racial) may question the stability of what we often deem enduring or artistic. The course pushes beyond a simple comparison/contrast approach and mere discussions of influence. Instead, we will think through the implications (theoretical, political and aesthetic) of revision, adaptation, and the intertextual. Finally, the class asks students to formulate their own aesthetic criteria through a close reading of both primary texts and secondary critical essays which will supplement the readings, film screenings, and artwork.",Rethinking the Classics: Contemporary Takes on the Canon,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,MET IS 345

,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), better known as   health  care reform, is the most important  and controversial piece of   federal social  legislation of this generation.  It is also basically an   insurance regulatory  statute.

,"Securitization and structured finance together constitute one of the most    dynamic segments of the financial markets. Securitization involves the   creation  and issuance of securities backed by one or more assets which   generate cash  flows sufficient to fund the securities. Structured finance   includes  securitization as well as transactions in which securities are not   issued, but  which involve the often complex structuring of cash flows to   achieve a desired  tax, accounting or financial objective. These   transactions often cut across many  areas of legal specialization, including   bank and thrift regulation, securities  regulation, taxation, bankruptcy and   insolvency, fiduciary law, real estate law  and environmental law. This   course examines a series of actual transactions to  explore the sometimes   contradictory ways that these various legal constructs  impinge upon the   structuring transactions. Examples include single-family  mortgage pools,   trade receivable securitizations and commercial mortgage  securitizations.

,"Transitional justice institutions are legal and quasi-legal mechanisms through  which states and societies attempt to address past wrongs, such as criminal  trials and truth commissions. Transitional justice scholarship studies these  responses to collective violence and asks how these responses affect  collective memory and democratization. Since the 1990s we witness important  innovations, with victim testimonies given a central role, didactic goals such  as clarifying history and shaping collective memory recognized as official  goals of the legal process, and the development of a human right to truth.  These innovations are understood as offering an alternative to the legalist  approach of criminal law -- one that espouses ideals of ""restorative justice.""  This seminar critically examines this claim with a careful study of the  building blocks of transitional justice. It argues that they can be traced  back to Holocaust trials, and in particular to the Eichmann trial that took  place in 1961 in Jerusalem. The course charts the contribution of Holocaust  trials to transitional justice practice and debates, focusing on the new role  of victims in transitional justice processes, the centrality of truth-seeking,  and the new relations between law and history. Finally, the seminar examines  the feminist critique of international law launched in the 1990s around the  ad-hoc tribunals of former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and how the development of a  gender sensitive jurisprudence conjoined with the rise of the witness in  Holocaust trials to offer a new Justice formed around victims and testimonies.

This seminar examines the unique role and power of prosecutors in the United States and their responsibility to ensure ""that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.""  We will study the ways in which a prosecutor exercises discretion -- in deciding what charges to bring (or whether to bring them at all), in conducting trials, in recommending punishment -- and the ethical and practical considerations that affect those determinations.  What duty does the prosecutor owe to the victim?  To the police?  To the public at large?  How might their interests conflict with prosecutors' objectives and impact their decisions?  A major focus of this course will be the prosecutor's obligations to the accused and the various ways in which they are breached.  We will examine the potential consequences of prosecutorial misconduct, the instances in which it may or may not be remedied, and to what extent it can be deterred.  Students will engage in mock disciplinary hearings, playing the role of bar counsel in bringing allegations of misconduct or defending prosecutors against such claims.  Throughout the semester we'll refer to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Model Code of Professional Responsibility, and other rules that govern the conduct of all lawyers while scrutinizing others that bind prosecutors but not defense attorneys.  Other topics to be covered include the relationship between the prosecutor and the grand jury, conflicts of interest, selective prosecution, trial misconduct, prosecutorial immunity, mandatory minimum sentences, the use of confidential informants and cooperating witnesses, discovery of exculpatory evidence, post-conviction obligations and wrongful convictions.

This seminar will examine the knotty legal questions underlying current wartime debates, with a primary focus on modern conflicts facing the United States in the post-9/11 era.  A complex architecture of international and domestic law governs states and state actors during wartime.  Evolving threats, new technologies, and domestic politics have tested these legal frameworks, and the domestic and international laws of war continue to adapt to challenges to their relevance and viability.  Topics for discussion may include, among others: Guantanamo detention, targeted killing and drones, interrogation and torture, humanitarian intervention in conflicts like those in Libya and Syria, and the scope of the U.S. President's constitutional and statutory authority to wage war.

,"Climate change is the most important environmental issue of this century. It has generated major law and policy over the last several years, both in the United States and internationally, and presents significant legal and policy issues that remain unresolved. This seminar will examine the legal tools currently available to address climate change and possibilities for future action, as well as related policy challenges. The seminar first will consider the international context and review the history of climate change efforts on a global scale, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the 2015 Paris Agreement. It will then focus on currently available U.S. authorities, including the Clean Air Act and executive branch powers. Because there is no statute that addresses climate change head-on, the seminar will consider the challenges presented when a major policy concern is advanced in the absence of a firm statutory foundation. Climate change also raises important issues of human rights, environmental justice, and international and intergenerational equity, which will be examined. Finally, the seminar will look to the future and pose questions concerning expectations for international cooperation, possible additional tools in current U.S. law, prospects for climate change legislation, and voluntary and market-based opportunities.

Many have served lengthy sentences and some have spent years on death row awaiting execution for crimes they did not commit.  This course will examine the broad range of factors that contribute to the wrongful conviction of the innocent and, in doing so, will shed light on broader questions about the functioning of the US criminal justice system.  We will explore the role played by faulty eyewitness-identification procedures; coercive and deceptive police interrogation procedures; the mishandling of confidential informants, cooperating witnesses, and jailhouse snitches; junk science, disorganized crime labs, and incompetent and corrupt experts; police and prosecutorial failures to preserve & disclose exculpatory evidence; and incompetent defense counsel and underfunded criminal-defense-delivery systems.  We will also examine the role of racial and ethnic bias, profiling, and tunnel vision, before considering how wrongful convictions affect the debate over the death penalty.  We will look the use of postconviction procedures such as appeals, new-trial motions, and habeas corpus petitions, to free the wrongfully convicted.

This course examines the historical, social and legal foundations for our current system.  We will examine the issue of ""rights"" as applied to children and  look at the effects of ideology and politics on the current juvenile justice system.  How have assumptions of childhood and responsibility changed?  Has the juvenile court been ""criminalized"" with the introduction of due process rights for children?  Under what circumstances are children treated as adult offenders?

,"This course is designed with occasional and situational preaching in view. It presupposes the probability  of both recurring and unique situations in which the gospel (the ""good news,"" not the final lection in the  ecumenical order) must be preached in a way both clear and arresting. To deal with this presupposition,  the course will deal with preaching the gospel when some situational feature of congregational or  organizational life demands attention.  Indirectly, it is also an exploration of theological method.   In whatever situation, the preaching task will be viewed as a theological one, i.e., as an opportunity for  discerning the import of and articulating the gospel anew in a given situation. Thus students will be  equipped to be ""theologians of the Word"" who can interpret situations from a variety of viewpoints,  evaluate the usefulness of various tools for preaching in light of the gospel and then employ them  fruitfully. In order to do this, we will work on the following tools: 1. Bringing to critical awareness our own understandings of the gospel, 2. Developing skills and resources as contextual theologians in residence, , and  3. Developing skills and resources as homiletical exegetes of situations. As a result students should develop greater pastoral sensitivity, rhetorical savvy and think-on-your-feet  theological acumen while preparing for preaching in a context in which transformational theological  leadership needs to be exercised.",DMin Preaching Course,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,STH TC 906

Upon this examination, the church's  pursuit of social justice emerges as a multifaceted practice that disturbs traditional  distinctions between the prophetic and priestly dimensions of the church's identity.   Through careful attention to the required texts, as well as the conduct of student research  and constructive reflection, course participants are encouraged to rediscover the practice of  seeking justice as an art of ministry -- as a dance through which prophetic and priestly  activities engage one another as partners.

In light of these contextual challenges, students will assess the  adequacy of diverse theological visions for the future of the Black Church.

Throughout the seminar,   there is consideration given to the philosophical and theological roots of the   BU ethical tradition as well as its social, economic, and political   applications. This tradition is based on the belief in a personal God who cares   about people, and made each person in the divine image-endowed with inherent   value, worth and dignity.

Non-Christians and atheists have interpreted Paul's work  in ways that have deepened our understanding of politics and social ethics of Christianity and even the  legacy of Christian thought on radical philosophy and revolutionary thought. We will, among others,  critically engage with the works of French philosophers Alain Badiou and Jean Luc-Nancy, Italian thinker  Giorgio Agamben, and Slovenian radical scholar Slavoj ÂiÂek, who are some of today's leading  interpreters of Paul and his influence on political theology/philosophy, community, messianism,  subjectivity, and social transformation. We will also study the works of scholars within the Christian  tradition who are picking on some of their radical insights and bringing them into theology, social  ethics, and biblical studies. All these new forms of scholarship making provocative proposals about  society and political philosophy prompt a re-turn to classical readings of Christian texts in order to  strengthen and broaden our knowledge of Christian thought as it applies to transformative praxis.

It is not about stewardship of personal money, but about the peculiar dialectics of the monetary structures and forces that frame existence and actively confront persons, peoples, classes, gender, races, and economies in today's world. It explores various transdisciplinary discourses of money not only to highlight the important role of money in constructing meaning and relationships, but also to uncover the central role of monetary systems in fostering economic inequality and social injustice. This course will shine a bright theological-ethical light on the motion of money in both national and global spheres so as to highlight the serious ethical issues that pertain to the production, circulation, control, and use of money in the structures and organizations of economic life.

,"Good ethical conception and practice often demand that we see things from others' points of view. Great  novels, plays, poems, and films are good at helping us to reach empathic perceptions of particular  people and situations by involving our intellect and emotion. Novels, tragic dramas, and others have the  capacity to make readers identify with fictional characters in ways that show possibilities and potential  vulnerabilities for themselves. This kind of empathic identification is important for good ethical practice  in diverse and pluralistic communities. Narrative works of art are important for developing the human  self-understanding critical for embodying certain religious and theological ideals. This course will  explore the connections between literature (novels, plays, and short stories) and ethics: the relationship  between creative imagination and moral imagination; the nature of moral attention and moral vision; the  role of context-specific judging in ethical decisions. The course will help students to deepen and  broaden their ethical understanding in ways that involve and give priority to context-specific moral  evaluation, compassion, similar possibilities and vulnerabilities, eudaimonistic judgment, rather than  abstract general principles for ethical judgment.",Literature and Ethics,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,STH TS 803

,"Thomas Aquinas is one of the most important figures in the history and development of Western  philosophy and Christian theology. On nearly everything he writes about -- from virtue to the  sacraments, metaphysics of identity to the incarnation, war to soteriology -- he has something  interesting, important, and illuminating to say. And whether one agrees with his particular conclusions  or not, it is difficult to engage his work without growing as a thinker and reader. This doctoral seminar  constitutes an extended engagement with Thomas's thought, primarily through attention to his Summa  theologiae.

,"Recent developments across a variety of disciplines have led to deep and widespread interest in ""political theology"" -- a  diverse range of approaches to interrogating, (re)imagining, and (de)constructing the intersection of politics, religion, and  theology, present and past. Scholars have argued that dominant paradigms of sovereignty, the secular, modernity, and  liberalism are themselves secularized, corrupted, or otherwise transformed versions of Jewish and Christian theology.  Others contend that modern political practices and paradigms represent not the legacy of early modern secularization but  the trail of an early modern reinjection of theology in political and social theory. Others still find in the practices of  contemporary communities lived political theologies that subvert existing power structures and cast doubt on common  conceptions of contemporary political life and possibilities.

,"The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for  understanding human behavior when challenges to healthy adult functioning  overwhelm coping mechanisms and resources.  A biopsychosocial model of  psychopathology is emphasized as we study some of the disorders classified in  the DSM-5, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders,  PTSD, dissociative disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and  substance abuse/addictions. Complex factors in the etiology of various disorders  are considered, including genetic, neurochemical, biological, developmental,  familial, sociocultural, and political variables that affect the occurrence,  presentation, course, and treatment of a problem.  While learning the  perspective and language of the phenomenological approach outlined in the DSM-5,  we also highlight weaknesses and blind spots in the traditional approach to  diagnoses.  In particular, we explore the impact of oppression and bias on the  naming and treatment of mental disorders, including the influences of race,  gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and ethnicity on the  diagnostic process.  Students learn to consider the DSM-5 classification system  as a social construction that reveals as much about the society and its views of  human behavior as it does about the clients with whom social workers have  contact.    While this course is not designed to focus on treatment, students  have the opportunity to consider how diagnoses inform treatment and review  current research on both biological and psychosocial treatments for different  disorders.  Finally, we seek to enhance empathic understanding of our clients  experiences and the experiences of their families and loved ones, remembering  that people are not their diagnoses, that what is labeled individual pathology  may be an adaptive response to oppressive external circumstances, and that  people who experience a breakdown in functioning demonstrate not only  difficulties but also compelling strengths.  This course employs lecture, large  and small group discussion, case presentations, and videotapes.

,"Although health care is rationed in a variety of ways in the United States, Americans, and American politicians in particular, make believe that rationing does not exist.   Indeed, efforts at health care reform have often been criticized for leading to ""rationing' health care resources, implying that rationing is something evil.   The idea that all Americans get the health care they need or that we have limitless resources is obviously not so. What health care is available and to whom is the result of the often invisible choices policy makers make.   This course critically explores the health care allocation choices that have been made and will be made in the future.  It analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of various rationing methods, the values and moral judgments reflected in each, and the political and financial factors influencing the choice of approach, as well as who should make such choices.  Examples of rationing to be discussed include the distribution of organs for transplantation, determining what constitutes ""necessary"" care under insurance schemes, the use of markets and lotteries as rationing methods, limitations on population screening, the use of age and ""social worth"" to limit health care to individuals, triage in emergencies, and the utility (or disutility) of cost-benefit analysis for making decisions about the availability and distribution of health care. By the end of the course, students will be able to articulate the range of possible rationing methods and to appropriately apply these methods to different scarce resource circumstances.

,"If Homer's Iliad is the first work of Western literature, as it well may be,  then the first word of Western literature is ""anger."" Homer begins his epic  with a particular word for anger, ""mÃªnis."" It is but one of several ancient  Greek words for this emotion, and means something like wrath, righteous and  vengeful fury. Consideration of Homer's famous portrayal of anger's meaning  and effects will lead us to these questions, among others: what is anger and  what shapes does it take? What leads us to feel it? Is it a good thing to  feel, or is it to be suppressed on grounds of its irrationality,  destructiveness, or its connection with possibly flawed quasi-moral notions  such as honor? Are there ever good reasons to give it up (for example, a  duty to forgive), and if so how should we understand forgiveness,  reconciliation, and the like? Anger and its modulations (resentment,  vengefulness, righteousness, indignation, malice, among others) certainly  seem to be extraordinarily prevalent and influential at multiple levels-- social,  interpersonal, and personal. In Homer and the Bible, even the  relation between humans and the divine is fraught with anger. In exploring  what anger is, we will delve into the philosophy of emotion, and therefore  into the relation of emotion to reason as well as to feeling and mood. In  discussing why we feel anger, we will examine its relation to self-esteem,  honor, and more broadly our nature as social beings. We will also consider  several emotions that are related to anger, such as envy, jealousy, and  love. Our readings will extend from Homer through the Bible, Plato,  Aristotle, the Stoics (in particular, Seneca's On Anger), Shakespeare, to  contemporary philosophers (some of whom approach the topic with issues of  gender, race, and social standing in view).

The  goals of this seminar are to examine the physical  principles underlying the  production, distribution and consumption of energy and  to use this  knowledge to explore and discuss such issues as energy conservation,  public  transport, the so-called hydrogen economy, electric and hybrid vehicles,   nuclear power and carbon sequestration, as well as to evaluate the  feasibility  of various alternative sources of energy sources. During the  Seminar, we  anticipate freewheeling conversations relating to various  energy-related issues,  such as: Are we running out of oil? What is the  evidence for anthropically  caused Global Warming? What can be done to  prevent (or prepare for) it? Can part  or all of the problem be solved by  alternative power sources? Is it feasible to  capture and sequester the CO2  produced by fossil power plants? How important is  it to conserve energy? ",Energy ,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,KHC PY 101
,"The 1950s was the origin of the Cognitive Revolution, when the mind was  first  viewed as a computational, symbol-processing machine. A succession of  other  ideas has been offered to understand mind and behavior.  Some  approaches were  initially scorned, such as evolutionary psychology; others  were influential  immediately, such as cognitive neuroscience.  This seminar  traces the different  disciplines that have contributed to modern  conceptions of mind, including  anthropology, economics, and animal  behavior.  Students will be able to choose  their own question of interest  for focused exploration while the class broadly  studies this explosive  half-century of intellectual evolution.
