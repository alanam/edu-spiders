," BE 428 is a project-based course developing fundamentals of the  design aspects of biomedical devices and diagnostics. Students will identify  design needs, evaluate possible solutions, build  prototypes and analyze  failure modes and their effects. At every stage of the design process, they  will present to the rest of the class to obtain feedback on their designs.  The course is designed for undergraduates in their Sophomore and Junior  years and satisfies a course elective requirement for the Technology  Innovation concentration. Case studies of biomedical device designs and  hands-on prototyping sessions are used extensively throughout the course.  These, as well as guest lectures and discussion sections, are designed to  encourage students to consider the broader social contexts of engineering  and design. Basic theory, homeworks, and brainstorming sessions will be  applied towards problem identification, materials selection, and failure  mode evaluation.Topics include: needs identification; materials classes;  materials selection for medical devices and diagnostics; failure analysis;  biocompatibility; regulatory requirements as they pertain to design,  manufacturing and marketing; technology assessment strategies; and  engineering ethics. Several case studies of successful and unsuccessful  biomedical device design are introduced and discussed throughout the course.  4 cr",Device Diagnostics and Design,Boston University,,www.bu.edu,4,ENG BE 428
,"Many vital physiological functions including locomotion, respiration,  circulation, and mechanotransduction are mechanical in nature and are linked  to forces and deformation.  Mechanics is also critical for development of  medical devices and instruments.  The main goal of this course is to  acquaint students with concepts of stress, strain, constitutive laws and  their applications to biomechanics of cells and tissues.  The focus will be  on theoretical developments.  The first part of the course is focused on  problems of mechanics of deformable solids including extension, bending,  buckling and torsion of beams, as well as the concept of cellular  tensegrity.  The second, and the greater part of the course is focused on  the basic concepts of the theory of elasticity. Topics include: vector and  tensor algebra and calculus, kinematics of deformation, stress analysis,  constitutive equations.  In addition to the linear (Hookean) elasticity,  non-linear elasticity is also presented to describe mechanical behavior of  biological tissues and cells.  The last chapter is devoted to basic concepts  of linear viscoelasticity, including stress relaxation, creep and  hysteresis.  Illustrative examples from tissue and cell biomechanics will be  given where appropriate.  The course will prepare students for advanced  courses in traditional fields of solid mechanics (elasticity, plasticity,  viscoelasticity, poroelasticity), finite element analysis, as well as  emerging fields (mechanobiology, computational mechanics, nanotechnology,  biotechnology).
