,"The law dictates that corporations, arguably the most influential institutions of our time, can have only one goal: to maximize profits for their shareholders. Corporations have no general legal or moral obligation to the well-being of society or individual consumers. This means that, if corporations are to be restrained from maximizing profit by harming the public good, they must be regulated. When regulation fails, and dangerous products make it into the marketplace, consumers who are harmed can bring product liability lawsuits. Despite these facts, massive deregulation has occurred in the U.S. and tort reform threatens the ability of consumers to bring product liability lawsuits. Using the food and tobacco industries as case studies, we will examine the history of deregulation and tort reform and answer the following question: How can law and government be used to protect society and consumers by regulating a system programmed to ignore the welfare of everyone except shareholders?","ALS-377 Pol of Regulation, Product Liability Litigation & Tort Reform",Suffolk University,www.suffolk.edu,,ALS-377
