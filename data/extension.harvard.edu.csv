,"Astrobiology, the subject of this course, is a new discipline born out of the convergence of all scientific inquiry currently under way on the question of the origin and development of life here on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the Universe. Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life in our solar system. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And astronomers have been recently successful in searching for planets around other stars. Searches for extra-solar planets are currently under way and are leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.","

Communities are created through virtual interactions, despite geographic dispersion, and trends can take hold globally in an instant. Yet, the rise of mass media creates questions and problems as well as possibilities: What happens to privacy in an era where so much is publicized and posted? What are the social consequences of recording so much of life, and how does the ubiquity of social media transform interpersonal interaction? What new forms of control and censorship might these technologies engender?

,"In 1903, W.E.B. DuBois wrote prophetically that ""the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line."" More recently, anthropologists and historians have argued that the very idea of race—the notion that human beings can be exhaustively divided into enduring groups such as whites, blacks, or Indians—was first invented in the New World, in the Americas. But what are races? Does it mean the same thing to be white in Boston as it does in Bogotá? If blackness in Alabama is rooted in assumptions about essential biological nature, does the same go for Rio de Janeiro? Is race simply an illusion, a convenient mask for political domination and economic exploitation? Can we hope to abolish the concept of race altogether, or is its grip too tenacious, its appeal to the psyche too great? This course considers episodes in the development of racial categories in Latin and North America. Our aim is to arrive at an overall sense of the nature of race in social life by comparing the logic of racial practices at different times and places in the hemisphere.","

,"Zero energy buildings, also known as net zero energy buildings are buildings (or a community of buildings) which produce with on-site renewables the same amount of energy as they consume, on an annual basis. Typically, a zero energy building consists of a highly-efficient building with rooftop, or site mounted, photovoltaic system. Zero energy is very scalable from single family homes to large commercial buildings to districts or communities of buildings. Once the realm of the most ambitious building owners willing to take significant financial risks, experience, technology, and financing mechanisms have begun to evolve to the point where a zero energy building can cost less to own and operate than a traditional code building. Indeed, Massachusetts is now beginning to see the emergence of spec-built zero energy homes, targeted at the affordable, low-income housing market. Other emerging trends include Executive Order 13514, which requires all new federal buildings to be designed to be zero energy by 2030, as well as various state and municipal initiatives. In the next few decades, it's possible that a large portion of new construction could be zero energy, either by code or by economics. This course provides a comprehensive exploration of zero energy buildings including building energy dynamics and renewable system fundamentals; energy economics, energy budgets, and site and source energy; relevant policy, codes, financing, and incentive structures; state of practice in zero energy design and construction, for both residential scale and commercial/institutional scale; case studies to demonstrate feasibility, key concepts, and lessons learned; the benefits and challenges zero energy imposes on the energy grid; the value zero energy can have in advancing security and resilience.","

,"In recent years, high performance green buildings have gone from fringe to main stream. Organizations and municipalities around the world have started requiring elements of green building on new construction and major renovations, green materials and equipment are abundant in the marketplace, energy disclosure ordinances are being adopted, and green building rating systems and standards are becoming part of the popular vernacular. Commitments made at COP 21 in Paris ensure this trend will continue over the next decade or more. We still have a long way to go and there is lots of room for improvement in the way we design, build, and operate our buildings, but there is definite movement in the right direction. While there is increasing support for green building, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions receive the bulk of the attention. There are many reasons for this: energy savings are relatively straightforward to quantify and verify and are easily translated into financial savings and returns on investment while global climate change is disproportionately affected by the built environment. Energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions are extremely important, but green building is an umbrella term that incorporates best practice and aspirational building design, construction, and operations strategies that are good for both the planet and people. This course exclusively looks at the impact of the built environment on people and demonstrates how green buildings can improve occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. It attempts to answer two questions: What makes a building healthy, comfortable, and productive for its occupants? How can we influence design, construction, and operations to ensure healthy, comfortable, and productive buildings? Students learn about occupants' interaction with light, color, sound, temperature and humidity, toxins and contaminants, plants and nature, and food and water. We review the most recent research in these areas and identify where additional research is needed. We also go through relevant green building standards, codes, and rating systems and discuss their applicability, strengths, and weaknesses. Students are introduced to design principles and tools for the design of healthy, comfortable, and productive facilities. Case studies demonstrate strategies to improve the occupant experience in office buildings, hospitals, schools, and residential buildings. Students leave the class with an understanding of these complex issues and are able to comfortably discuss setting goals and evaluating performance related to the occupant experience.","

,"Understanding the dynamics of complex ecological and environmental systems and designing policies to promote their sustainability is a formidable challenge. Both the practitioner and policymaker must be able to evaluate scientific research, recognizing fundamental pitfalls in research design and data interpretation. Moreover, most important environmental problems involve interactions among variables as dynamic systems, so forecasting the impacts of potential environmental changes or policy interventions is critical. To develop these skills, students conduct practical exercises illustrating a range of modeling techniques, including statistical analysis of ecological and environmental data, and system dynamics modeling.

,"This course is designed specifically for secondary school educators interested in developing their expertise as readers and teachers of literature. In this course, we consider those American poets whose themes, forms, and voices have given expression to visions of the city since 1850.  Beginning with Walt Whitman, the great poet of nineteenth-century New York, we explore the diverse and ever-changing environment of the modern city—from Chicago to London, from San Francisco to Detroit—through the eyes of such poets as Carl Sandburg, Emma Lazarus, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, Marianne Moore, Frank OHara, Gwendolyn Brooks, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Hayden, and Robert Pinsky, as well as contemporary hip hop and spoken word artists.  Deep study of the poems and poets on our syllabus provides an opportunity to develop expertise as classroom educators. As we develop and practice advanced strategies for studying American poetry ourselves, we also gain rich new resources for the classroom. This course introduces content and techniques intended to help educators teach their students how to read texts of increasing complexity. The course meets relevant educational standards for grades 6-12, including the Common Core State Standards.","

,"One might reasonably conclude that all narrators in fiction or in life are to some extent fallible or unreliable. Our focus specifically engages the question of how selected authors further their artistic purposes by creating narrators who subtly or blatantly confuse appearance and reality, fancy and fact, opportunism and beneficence, opacity and insight. In the process, we address the implications and relevance of such labels as hero, lunatic, scoundrel. Our consideration of narrative strategies leads to an exploration of the manner in which these fictions can illuminate one another and, in the process, deepen our understanding of literature, our own lives, and the lives of others. We read and discuss the following literary works (not necessarily in strict chronological order) with a close eye on the narrators who tell us their stories: Herman Melville's short story, ""Bartleby the Scrivener,"" (1853); Henry James' novella, ","

War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead."" This course explores this powerful and contradictory phenomenon through the intimate accounts of those who, like O'Brien, experienced it first hand, from the Civil War through twenty-first century conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We find common threads through these accounts—compelling tales of fear and camaraderie, horror and honor delivered even as their authors worry that, as Walt Whitman put it, ""the real war will never get in the books."" We explore how war memoirs have changed, too, both as the nature of war has changed and as the nature of those who fight has changed. In addition to reading texts by men and women, volunteers and conscripts, generals and privates, we also meet war memoirists in person.","

,"When does science go too far? What are (or should be) its limitations? The scientist in literature is often represented as mad because of his willingness to go to any length to advance the cause of science—and never more so than when experiments have unintended consequences or escape the scientist's control. This fear of science and the scientist becomes a serious literary preoccupation during the nineteenth century, when experiments in electricity, reanimation, chemistry, surgery, vivisection, the use of new technologies, and the implications of Darwinism were being widely discussed and their morality questioned. With the birth of the nuclear age in the twentieth century, public anxiety about science and its uses only intensified.

This course begins with the poetry of the American Civil War and the series of major events and social movements that followed it—including Reconstruction, the Jim Crow Era, and Manifest Destiny, to name just a few. Encountering such poets as Herman Melville, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Edward Arlington Robinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, Emma Lazarus and W.E.B. DuBois, we examine the language of patriotism, pride, violence, loss, and memory inspired by the nation's greatest conflict. As we enter the twentieth century, we encounter modernism, a movement that spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and whose poetry marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms. We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation.

First, we encounter Walt Whitman, a quintessentially American writer whose work continues to bear heavily upon the American poetic tradition. We explore Whitman's relationship to the city, the self, and the body through his life and poetry. Then, we turn to Emily Dickinson, one of America's most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime. Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we consider a number of Dickinson's poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with nature, art, the self, and darkness. We travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886.

,"In this course we read several landmark novels and examples of short fiction. We begin at a time in which many writers left for Europe to leave behind a country they considered provincial while others immigrated to the United States as a refuge. We examine how these continued exchanges across the Atlantic and the experiences of the World Wars and the Holocaust affected and reshaped the rich American novelistic traditions. Proceeding largely in chronological order, the sequence of readings is divided thematically. The readings cluster around the way in which traditional American settings and literary forms interact with and adapt to national and transatlantic historical change. These changes are readily reflected in the novels of immigration, the Lost Generation, and the World Wars, but they also make themselves felt subtly in the way American writers think about the suburb, a direct result of World War II, negotiate the relationship between individualism and the shaping influence of family legacies, and try to grapple with the lasting effects of slavery.","

,"This course explores the debate about the minimum wage from all points of view. What is the history of the minimum wage in the US? Who is affected? Does the minimum wage reduce employment of low wage workers, as some argue? Does it have a significant impact on their incomes? Should the federal government raise the minimum wage? Abolish it? Leave it to the states? Why do some firms pay entry-level workers more than the minimum wage while other firms in the same industry do not? Students review the arguments and evidence on the minimum wage, investigate what economists have learned about its impact, understand why firms might choose to pay more than the minimum wage, review and evaluate current proposals to raise the minimum wage, and explore some of the philosophical and ethical issues raised about labor markets, income inequality, and low income workers","

,"This performance course for all levels of singers focuses on vocal technique, acting of a song, and the study of Broadway musicals from the current century. Throughout the course, we practice vocal warm-ups, building technique and confidence. Each student learns a piece from this repertoire, working on both vocal and theatrical aspects and digging deeply into the text and character. In some cases students may collaborate in order to create more fully-formed scenes for their classmates. Written work includes brief descriptions of listening assignments, and the final consists of a paper and presentation based on each student's research of the song and show, including a polished performance of the song.","

,"This course is an intensive study of Shakespeare's dramatic works from the point of view of the actor. It is important to remember that Shakespeare's verse dramas were written to be performed and that only when they are approached this way—as playable, theatrical texts—do they have their maximum impact. Through text analysis, scene study, vocal work, and acting exercises we attempt to find, not only the meaning, but the music and theatrical power of Shakespeare's words. We spend a great deal of class time discussing blank verse and the different techniques for speaking it out loud and work to develop the end-of-line breath support needed to perform this language. We also study such topics as scansion, phrasing, word emphasis, antithesis, and imagery.","

,"Short films are an exciting and ever-evolving form of storytelling in the digital age. This course explores the strong tradition short films have in our culture, as well as the new and innovative techniques filmmakers are currently using to tell and distribute their stories. In this course, students devote the entire semester to the creation and completion of one short film, narrative or documentary, with the intent of festival submission and/or online release. Students work in a collaborative atmosphere with classmates and the instructor to refine scripts and treatments, plan productions, and create the final film. Students may work individually or partner in a collaborative team. Either way, the class serves as a support system for each student, offering advice, critiques, and resources so that each member of the class is an integral part of a fully-realized short. In addition to supporting traditional filmmaking approaches, innovative storytelling techniques are strongly welcomed and supported. These can include interactive online documentaries, hybrid approaches (blending fiction and nonfiction), webisode pilots, and experimental techniques. Additionally, the course demystifies the online distribution process and the film festival circuit, exploring the many avenues filmmakers can take to get their work shown to a wider audience.","

Light has basic properties such as brightness, size of source, color, angle of throw, and the directional movement of its rays. Cameras are the tools that allow us to interpret these properties to create an image. Through hands-on projects we build our understanding of the ways in which light can be manipulated for aesthetic intent. Assignments build in complexity throughout the semester exploring the relative relationships between camera controls and lighting properties. Once we have a strong understanding of these relationships we move into post-production and investigate color correction, color grading, and working with green screen footage. The goal of this course is to build a fundamental understanding of lighting relationships in order to achieve the desired look on set and in the editing suite.","

,"Some call it the share economy, others the gig economy; still others prefer the freelance or access economy. In this course, we explore the impact new technology is having on how firms connect to their customers, how they compete with incumbent and new firms in their product market, and what this means for workers and outcomes in labor markets. How many workers and firms are affected? Are there limits to what types/how many workers and firms are likely to be affected? What can we learn from Hollywood? We look at previous historical examples of this type of organization—including the movie and TV industry which has long had a disaggregated approach to producing its product and hiring workers. We examine Uber, AirBnb, and similar firms. How was their rise facilitated by new technology? What do they provide their customer that was not previously available? How is this changing competition?  What is the nature of this new employment relationship with workers? Are the employees independent contractors, or something in between? To what extent does this affect labor market outcomes including flexibility and worker autonomy, but also worker income, non-wage benefits such as health insurance, and income security? To what extent do these new relationships—between customer and firm and between firm and worker—require new types of government oversight or regulation (if any)?","

,"This course reviews development policy making in urban areas, focusing on differing economic, demographic, institutional, and political settings. Course topics include a critical analysis of the continuing viability of cities in the context of current economic and demographic dynamics, fiscal stress, governance, economic development, poverty and race, drugs, homelessness, federal urban policy, and survival strategies for declining cities. The course considers economic development, social equity, and job growth in the context of metropolitan regions, and addresses federal, state, and local government strategies for expanding community economic development and affordable housing opportunities. Of special concern is the continuing spatial and racial isolation and concentration of low-income populations, especially minority populations, residing in urban communities including older, industrial cities. The course examines how market forces and pressures affect the availability of affordable housing, exacerbate the impacts of gentrification, and inhibit the availability of capital for affordable housing and economic development. It also examines how issues around growing housing affordability problems, the changing structure of capital markets, the reduction of low-skilled jobs in central city locations, and racial discrimination combine to limit housing and employment opportunities.","

,"This course closely examines the path of public policy, whether fiscal stimulus plans or the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, through the nuts and bolts of—and from the viewpoint of—the capital markets. When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence.
