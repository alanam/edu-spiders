,"Astrobiology, the subject of this course, is a new discipline born out of the convergence of all scientific inquiry currently under way on the question of the origin and development of life here on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the Universe. Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life in our solar system. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And astronomers have been recently successful in searching for planets around other stars. Searches for extra-solar planets are currently under way and are leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.","

Communities are created through virtual interactions, despite geographic dispersion, and trends can take hold globally in an instant. Yet, the rise of mass media creates questions and problems as well as possibilities: What happens to privacy in an era where so much is publicized and posted? What are the social consequences of recording so much of life, and how does the ubiquity of social media transform interpersonal interaction? What new forms of control and censorship might these technologies engender?

,"In 1903, W.E.B. DuBois wrote prophetically that ""the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line."" More recently, anthropologists and historians have argued that the very idea of race—the notion that human beings can be exhaustively divided into enduring groups such as whites, blacks, or Indians—was first invented in the New World, in the Americas. But what are races? Does it mean the same thing to be white in Boston as it does in Bogotá? If blackness in Alabama is rooted in assumptions about essential biological nature, does the same go for Rio de Janeiro? Is race simply an illusion, a convenient mask for political domination and economic exploitation? Can we hope to abolish the concept of race altogether, or is its grip too tenacious, its appeal to the psyche too great? This course considers episodes in the development of racial categories in Latin and North America. Our aim is to arrive at an overall sense of the nature of race in social life by comparing the logic of racial practices at different times and places in the hemisphere.","

,"Zero energy buildings, also known as net zero energy buildings are buildings (or a community of buildings) which produce with on-site renewables the same amount of energy as they consume, on an annual basis. Typically, a zero energy building consists of a highly-efficient building with rooftop, or site mounted, photovoltaic system. Zero energy is very scalable from single family homes to large commercial buildings to districts or communities of buildings. Once the realm of the most ambitious building owners willing to take significant financial risks, experience, technology, and financing mechanisms have begun to evolve to the point where a zero energy building can cost less to own and operate than a traditional code building. Indeed, Massachusetts is now beginning to see the emergence of spec-built zero energy homes, targeted at the affordable, low-income housing market. Other emerging trends include Executive Order 13514, which requires all new federal buildings to be designed to be zero energy by 2030, as well as various state and municipal initiatives. In the next few decades, it's possible that a large portion of new construction could be zero energy, either by code or by economics. This course provides a comprehensive exploration of zero energy buildings including building energy dynamics and renewable system fundamentals; energy economics, energy budgets, and site and source energy; relevant policy, codes, financing, and incentive structures; state of practice in zero energy design and construction, for both residential scale and commercial/institutional scale; case studies to demonstrate feasibility, key concepts, and lessons learned; the benefits and challenges zero energy imposes on the energy grid; the value zero energy can have in advancing security and resilience.","

,"In recent years, high performance green buildings have gone from fringe to main stream. Organizations and municipalities around the world have started requiring elements of green building on new construction and major renovations, green materials and equipment are abundant in the marketplace, energy disclosure ordinances are being adopted, and green building rating systems and standards are becoming part of the popular vernacular. Commitments made at COP 21 in Paris ensure this trend will continue over the next decade or more. We still have a long way to go and there is lots of room for improvement in the way we design, build, and operate our buildings, but there is definite movement in the right direction. While there is increasing support for green building, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions receive the bulk of the attention. There are many reasons for this: energy savings are relatively straightforward to quantify and verify and are easily translated into financial savings and returns on investment while global climate change is disproportionately affected by the built environment. Energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions are extremely important, but green building is an umbrella term that incorporates best practice and aspirational building design, construction, and operations strategies that are good for both the planet and people. This course exclusively looks at the impact of the built environment on people and demonstrates how green buildings can improve occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. It attempts to answer two questions: What makes a building healthy, comfortable, and productive for its occupants? How can we influence design, construction, and operations to ensure healthy, comfortable, and productive buildings? Students learn about occupants' interaction with light, color, sound, temperature and humidity, toxins and contaminants, plants and nature, and food and water. We review the most recent research in these areas and identify where additional research is needed. We also go through relevant green building standards, codes, and rating systems and discuss their applicability, strengths, and weaknesses. Students are introduced to design principles and tools for the design of healthy, comfortable, and productive facilities. Case studies demonstrate strategies to improve the occupant experience in office buildings, hospitals, schools, and residential buildings. Students leave the class with an understanding of these complex issues and are able to comfortably discuss setting goals and evaluating performance related to the occupant experience.","

,"Understanding the dynamics of complex ecological and environmental systems and designing policies to promote their sustainability is a formidable challenge. Both the practitioner and policymaker must be able to evaluate scientific research, recognizing fundamental pitfalls in research design and data interpretation. Moreover, most important environmental problems involve interactions among variables as dynamic systems, so forecasting the impacts of potential environmental changes or policy interventions is critical. To develop these skills, students conduct practical exercises illustrating a range of modeling techniques, including statistical analysis of ecological and environmental data, and system dynamics modeling.

,"This course is designed specifically for secondary school educators interested in developing their expertise as readers and teachers of literature. In this course, we consider those American poets whose themes, forms, and voices have given expression to visions of the city since 1850.  Beginning with Walt Whitman, the great poet of nineteenth-century New York, we explore the diverse and ever-changing environment of the modern city—from Chicago to London, from San Francisco to Detroit—through the eyes of such poets as Carl Sandburg, Emma Lazarus, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, Marianne Moore, Frank OHara, Gwendolyn Brooks, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Hayden, and Robert Pinsky, as well as contemporary hip hop and spoken word artists.  Deep study of the poems and poets on our syllabus provides an opportunity to develop expertise as classroom educators. As we develop and practice advanced strategies for studying American poetry ourselves, we also gain rich new resources for the classroom. This course introduces content and techniques intended to help educators teach their students how to read texts of increasing complexity. The course meets relevant educational standards for grades 6-12, including the Common Core State Standards.","

,"One might reasonably conclude that all narrators in fiction or in life are to some extent fallible or unreliable. Our focus specifically engages the question of how selected authors further their artistic purposes by creating narrators who subtly or blatantly confuse appearance and reality, fancy and fact, opportunism and beneficence, opacity and insight. In the process, we address the implications and relevance of such labels as hero, lunatic, scoundrel. Our consideration of narrative strategies leads to an exploration of the manner in which these fictions can illuminate one another and, in the process, deepen our understanding of literature, our own lives, and the lives of others. We read and discuss the following literary works (not necessarily in strict chronological order) with a close eye on the narrators who tell us their stories: Herman Melville's short story, ""Bartleby the Scrivener,"" (1853); Henry James' novella, ","

War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead."" This course explores this powerful and contradictory phenomenon through the intimate accounts of those who, like O'Brien, experienced it first hand, from the Civil War through twenty-first century conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We find common threads through these accounts—compelling tales of fear and camaraderie, horror and honor delivered even as their authors worry that, as Walt Whitman put it, ""the real war will never get in the books."" We explore how war memoirs have changed, too, both as the nature of war has changed and as the nature of those who fight has changed. In addition to reading texts by men and women, volunteers and conscripts, generals and privates, we also meet war memoirists in person.","

,"When does science go too far? What are (or should be) its limitations? The scientist in literature is often represented as mad because of his willingness to go to any length to advance the cause of science—and never more so than when experiments have unintended consequences or escape the scientist's control. This fear of science and the scientist becomes a serious literary preoccupation during the nineteenth century, when experiments in electricity, reanimation, chemistry, surgery, vivisection, the use of new technologies, and the implications of Darwinism were being widely discussed and their morality questioned. With the birth of the nuclear age in the twentieth century, public anxiety about science and its uses only intensified.

This course begins with the poetry of the American Civil War and the series of major events and social movements that followed it—including Reconstruction, the Jim Crow Era, and Manifest Destiny, to name just a few. Encountering such poets as Herman Melville, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Edward Arlington Robinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, Emma Lazarus and W.E.B. DuBois, we examine the language of patriotism, pride, violence, loss, and memory inspired by the nation's greatest conflict. As we enter the twentieth century, we encounter modernism, a movement that spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and whose poetry marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms. We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation.

First, we encounter Walt Whitman, a quintessentially American writer whose work continues to bear heavily upon the American poetic tradition. We explore Whitman's relationship to the city, the self, and the body through his life and poetry. Then, we turn to Emily Dickinson, one of America's most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime. Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we consider a number of Dickinson's poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with nature, art, the self, and darkness. We travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886.

,"In this course we read several landmark novels and examples of short fiction. We begin at a time in which many writers left for Europe to leave behind a country they considered provincial while others immigrated to the United States as a refuge. We examine how these continued exchanges across the Atlantic and the experiences of the World Wars and the Holocaust affected and reshaped the rich American novelistic traditions. Proceeding largely in chronological order, the sequence of readings is divided thematically. The readings cluster around the way in which traditional American settings and literary forms interact with and adapt to national and transatlantic historical change. These changes are readily reflected in the novels of immigration, the Lost Generation, and the World Wars, but they also make themselves felt subtly in the way American writers think about the suburb, a direct result of World War II, negotiate the relationship between individualism and the shaping influence of family legacies, and try to grapple with the lasting effects of slavery.","

,"This course explores the debate about the minimum wage from all points of view. What is the history of the minimum wage in the US? Who is affected? Does the minimum wage reduce employment of low wage workers, as some argue? Does it have a significant impact on their incomes? Should the federal government raise the minimum wage? Abolish it? Leave it to the states? Why do some firms pay entry-level workers more than the minimum wage while other firms in the same industry do not? Students review the arguments and evidence on the minimum wage, investigate what economists have learned about its impact, understand why firms might choose to pay more than the minimum wage, review and evaluate current proposals to raise the minimum wage, and explore some of the philosophical and ethical issues raised about labor markets, income inequality, and low income workers","

It is important to remember that Shakespeare's verse dramas were written to be performed and that only when they are approached this way—as playable, theatrical texts—do they have their maximum impact. Through text analysis, scene study, vocal work, and acting exercises we attempt to find, not only the meaning, but the music and theatrical power of Shakespeare's words. We spend a great deal of class time discussing blank verse and the different techniques for speaking it out loud and work to develop the end-of-line breath support needed to perform this language.

In this course, we explore the impact new technology is having on how firms connect to their customers, how they compete with incumbent and new firms in their product market, and what this means for workers and outcomes in labor markets. How many workers and firms are affected? Are there limits to what types/how many workers and firms are likely to be affected? What can we learn from Hollywood? We look at previous historical examples of this type of organization—including the movie and TV industry which has long had a disaggregated approach to producing its product and hiring workers. We examine Uber, AirBnb, and similar firms. How was their rise facilitated by new technology? What do they provide their customer that was not previously available? How is this changing competition?  What is the nature of this new employment relationship with workers? Are the employees independent contractors, or something in between? To what extent does this affect labor market outcomes including flexibility and worker autonomy, but also worker income, non-wage benefits such as health insurance, and income security? To what extent do these new relationships—between customer and firm and between firm and worker—require new types of government oversight or regulation (if any)?","

Course topics include a critical analysis of the continuing viability of cities in the context of current economic and demographic dynamics, fiscal stress, governance, economic development, poverty and race, drugs, homelessness, federal urban policy, and survival strategies for declining cities. The course considers economic development, social equity, and job growth in the context of metropolitan regions, and addresses federal, state, and local government strategies for expanding community economic development and affordable housing opportunities. Of special concern is the continuing spatial and racial isolation and concentration of low-income populations, especially minority populations, residing in urban communities including older, industrial cities. The course examines how market forces and pressures affect the availability of affordable housing, exacerbate the impacts of gentrification, and inhibit the availability of capital for affordable housing and economic development. It also examines how issues around growing housing affordability problems, the changing structure of capital markets, the reduction of low-skilled jobs in central city locations, and racial discrimination combine to limit housing and employment opportunities.","

When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence. The role of important constituents (commercial and investment banks, exchanges, regulators, hedge funds, government interventions) are reviewed and evaluated for both past performance and future relevance. The course addresses important current topics in both economics and public policy, such as too big to fail, moral hazard, globalization of markets, currency unions, liquidity traps, efficiency of markets, the role of credit rating agencies, shadow banking, regulation of derivatives and hedge funds, Glass-Steagall, and the Volcker Rule.","

Students also consider the role program theory plays in guiding those efforts in practice. They learn to assess the impact of these efforts and to improve programs based on those assessments. Students study the way social entrepreneurs generate and mobilize resources, negotiate partnerships with the public sector, and create and sustain organizations to support both innovation and the transition to institutionalization.  At the beginning, the course examines the reemergence of public-private partnerships in education, and the role of social entrepreneurs in that process.  Using a series of cases on social entrepreneurs and educational innovation, we discuss how program theory contributes to the success of a particular project, and examine how these projects evolve, from initial design to improving effectiveness and refining program theory, and finally to scale-up and institutionalization.

,"In this course, students use a design thinking methodology to design and develop an authentic learning product or experience. Each student prepares a product, such as a course or workshop, social learning community, website, or software application. Using rapid prototyping, students present several iterations of their designs to the class, participate in peer critiques, and continually improve their products over the semester. As instructional designers work in a team, each student contributes to, and benefits from, a class consulting bank. They use their skills to help others and to gain currency that they can exchange for help on their own projects. Students also explore additional instructional design frameworks and learning theories to improve fluency and flexible thinking in the field.","

,"How do adults learn most effectively online? The online learning environment differs from traditional on-ground approaches and relies heavily on active collaborative techniques to help learners construct knowledge and build community, but why? This course focuses on designing instruction for the unique needs of adult online learners, critically examining related learning theories, instructional design practices, and online teaching strategies. Students examine dynamics that lead to online learning success, developing an appreciation for how adult learning theory informs effective instruction. In addition, as students collaboratively develop online lessons, they utilize design thinking, a framework leveraged by many highly innovative organizations today. In this case, students learn their way into inventive instructional solutions by analyzing adult online learner traits, acquiring interviewing techniques to identify desired learning outcomes, ideating and rapidly creating prototypes, pivoting as brainstorming leads to alternative approaches, and ultimately developing effective learner-centered activities and assessment strategies. Design thinking challenges the designer to develop empathy for stakeholders—in this case, the adult learner. Given a foundation in adult online learning theory, students conduct an empathetic exploration of best practices in designing instruction and online facilitation, comparing and contrasting these approaches, as well as examining quality rubrics published by organizations such as Quality Matters and the Online Learning Consortium. This course is of particular interest to those professionals who contribute to online teaching and learning outcomes in higher education or corporate settings.","

,"Behind every good learning tool—be it a website, app, webinar, online course, workshop, or interactive museum exhibit—is the work of an instructional designer. Instructional design is a creative process that uses learning theories and frameworks, project planning, content expertise, communication, writing, and technology to architect experiences for today's learners. The best instructional designers are agile and adaptable; they can quickly synthesize unfamiliar content, evaluate new technologies, and develop learning solutions that best meet the needs of a diverse audience. In this course, students work together to produce learning experiences using today's media and technologies. The gap between theory and practice is an issue in many fields. By using a project-based approach, we work to close that gap by learning about instructional design theories and frameworks while developing a series of products; students submit a project every two weeks. This course is helpful for those professionals who work directly or indirectly to support and improve learning in their organizations, or those lifelong learners who want to better understand how to use technology to manage their own learning.","

We ascertain recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles without, however, overlooking critical differences. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes over and over again? The great meltdown happened at a time when most macroeconomists (including Nobel Prize winner Bob Lucas as well as none other than the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke) were writing about the great moderation, that is, that business cycles have vanished for all practical purposes. They, along with most of their colleagues, were dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of the global economy in which we live and work.

,"Globalization is no longer an academic theory; it is a reality that affects all of our lives. From the foods we eat to the goods we buy, the ubiquity of developing countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and former Soviet Union—those frequently referred to as emerging markets—intensifies daily. Yet beyond the well-documented commercial and cultural impacts of globalization, there are strong but less visible trends towards greater global financial and investment integration. What makes emerging financial markets different from those in the US, Europe, or Japan? What are the benefits of adding these markets to a traditional investment portfolio? How do policies shape these markets? Why invest in certain countries versus others? Within a country, which asset class should we invest in? How do hedge funds approach these markets vs. traditional investors? How has the global credit crisis that began in 2007 altered the trajectories of developing and industrialized countries? From the practical perspective of a US institutional investor, this course is geared to help answer these questions. Students develop greater abilities to analyze global macro trends and country fundamentals, master portfolio construction concepts, and implement practical investment strategies.","

We review the methods by which real property investments are analyzed—including both financial and nonfinancial considerations. Students then step into the shoes of a first-time investor, meet the various players in the process, and weigh the risks and opportunities from the standpoint of an individual investor as well as a lender. Next, students gain experience in assessing investors' specific needs, creating financial feasibility analyses of several competing projects, and selecting the most appropriate investments. We examine operational aspects of real estate projects while grappling with coordinating a warehouse rehabilitation project, deciding how to set fair benchmark accountability standards for third-party contractors and how to align incentives—all while staying on schedule and on budget. Students gain experience in the time-honored real estate skills of diplomacy, consensus building, and good old-fashioned horse trading as they negotiate with a large tenant and, in another case study, pursue a development in an urban setting surrounded by myriad concerned (and active) community stakeholders. Students experience the real estate field from a small financial services company's viewpoint and address the perennial dilemma of whether to risk transitioning into a large institutionalized company or risk remaining a small entrepreneurial company indefinitely.

Then in ensuing weeks, months, and years, an affected city or region must initiate recovery from the physical damage, social and economic disruption, and demoralization of a catastrophe. This course focuses on the management of humanitarian relief—shelter, food, medical care, and the restoration of critical public services and basic economic activity—once disaster rescues have been accomplished; and it looks at the dynamics of community recovery in the aftermath of major disasters. But these processes are not exclusively post-disaster; society must take steps in advance to be prepared to provide relief rapidly and make recovery as speedy and complete as possible.

It focuses both on what responders must do during the critical period of crisis response and on how organizations can prepare themselves for high performance in these situations.

,"We live in a global service economy. The percentage of people employed in services has steadily increased in every developed country, exceeding 80 percent in the US in 2010. In 2011, an estimated 79.6 percent of the US GDP was created by the services sector. Emerging economies have similarly seen explosive growth in the percentage of their workforce employed in the provision of services, as trends as offshoring and outsourcing become more prevalent. This course explores how leaders design service experiences and systems to manage employees and customers to consistently deliver exceptional and profitable services. Through case studies from a variety of industries (retail, banking, technology), and the sharing of professional experiences, students gain practical insights that can be readily applied in the workplace. In the first part of the course, we discuss operational topics, including the trade-offs involved in the service model, the customer and management systems, and the funding mechanism. We touch upon customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. The concepts of service journey, capacity, and demand management cap this section of the course. We then embark onto a series of interactive highly practical workshops designed to study design thinking, with a specific focus on the service design toolset. Students gain proficiency in human-centered approaches such as blueprinting, customer journeys, and the hear-create-deliver methodology. This combination of operational metrics and creative thinking uniquely equips students to have an immediate impact.","

The idea of corporations as simply wealth-creating organizations with no obligations to the environment is no longer acceptable. Globalization and increased transparency of corporate operations have revealed significant variations in how organizations attempt to balance the pursuit of profits and good corporate citizenship. Expectations for measurable progress of corporate environmental programs addressing natural resources, pollution controls, monitoring ethical supply chains, and expanded training of employees are growing globally. Stakeholder expectations have accelerated the need to monetize these initiatives. However, the lack of standardized methodology and metrics has resulted in confusion within many industries, hindering progress.

,"This course is about how to develop, tailor and apply decision-making frameworks to real world strategy problems. It complements standard strategy courses in a number of important ways. Whereas standard strategy courses typically provide conceptual approaches to formulate strategies to establish sustainable competitive advantage, we focus on short- to medium-term margin improvement. The majority of the course content focuses on hands-on tools and frameworks that help strategic and marketing managers formulate strategy to obtain short-to medium term advantages rather than long term competitive advantage. In standard strategy courses a number of theoretically sound frameworks of analysis are introduced. This course builds on them but focuses on the how question: Which framework is relevant for what problem? What are the key operational steps to approach a strategy problem (such as entry into a market), and how does one tailor them to the specific company and industry situation? In standard strategy case-based courses, students typically learn to provide strategic solutions from given case information whereas a real world strategy problem often has a blank sheet as a starting point. This course addresses questions such as: How do we gather the right information to address a strategic issue, given real world informational constraints? How do we process that information for improved decision-making?","

First, we turn back the clock to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and investigate what it took to deliver drugs and save lives. By doing so, we develop a diverse toolkit that introduces students to approaches from history, anthropology, public health, law, and medicine. The goal is to understand illness as both something that happens in the body and something that happens in society. With these approaches in our toolbox, we turn our attention to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the subsequent cholera epidemic. We ask hard questions about the unintended consequences of good intentions and consider the challenges of providing care in the poorest parts of the world. Finally, we turn to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which the World Health Organization called ""the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times."" We read about the response from Partners in Health and Last Mile Health and see what happened when modern medicine met this deadly illness—only to ask why it never had before.

This course explores the cultural dimensions of social class in the US from an ethnographic perspective, focusing on the everyday lives and cultures of ordinary Americans. We consider questions such as the following: what is it like to be a working class person in a society heavily invested in ideas of individual advancement and meritocracy? How do professionals (the upper middle class) define themselves and how do they view those above and below them in the class structure? How does social class shape people's values, political views, and tastes? How are class boundaries created and maintained? The course readings are drawn mainly from anthropology and sociology.","

Whether you are selling a product, an intervention, or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today's dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business, or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention, and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a silver bullet and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences. Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practices, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders, and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit citizenship, and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include cause-related marketing and cause branding, nonprofit branding, and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.","

,"This course focuses on three core marketing strategies: positioning, branding, and building trust. In today's market, almost any product or service can be transformed into a commodity quickly as competitors copy successful products. Students learn how to analyze the competition, and then position and brand products or services in the marketplace to prevent them from being turned into commodities. Case examples are used to illustrate theory as well as how to build, manage, and measure brands. By the conclusion of the course, participants understand the key variables to a successful branding campaign and have a blueprint to use for their own campaigns.","

How have museums evolved from the transformation of the Louvre Palace into a public museum during the French Revolution, to the spectacular museum architecture found around the world today? Through a series of case studies of international museums, dating primarily from the past seventy-five years, we examine each museum's history, collections, and mission in relation to its architecture. Finally, we look at the process for developing an architectural feasibility study for the creation, renovation, or expansion of a museum.","

,"This course gives museum administrators and educators new tools for making museums agents of change in the world. Using the pre-texts model, an artist/educator training program that combines high-order literacy, innovation, and citizenship, the course encourages students to develop hands-on, art-making activities that turn museum collections into resources for exploring difficult texts. Art works are studied and used to create visual and performative interpretations of challenging written material that people would otherwise not access. In this way, museums play a central role in developing good readers and engaged viewers of art. Museum staff expand their role beyond traditional modes of providing outreach to engage their visitors with the texts through art and vice-versa, making for a deeper and more meaningful learning experience in the museum setting. In this active learning weekend, students hear lectures, make their own art, and experience the pre-texts that their museum visitors might use. They are challenged to step outside of the box to think creatively about how their museum or a museum might work with its community in new ways that develop an appreciation for art and citizenship.","

,"Museums are changing. Many are experimenting with shifting old models of exhibit-based, one-way communication in favor of engagement strategies that involve participation and meaningful involvement of nontraditional audiences. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History has created a new physical space and initiative called Q?rius that has been experimenting with creative audience interaction. Opened in 2013, educators use the space to prototype, test, refine, and deploy many kinds of interactive activities and programs from games to collections-based labs and digital fieldbooks to experimental scientist programs. At the heart of the initiative is an active group of youth from local communities underrepresented in science who act as activity advisors and visitor facilitators in the space. In this course, the educators who created and run Q?rius lead students in activities that allow them to experience the process of developing a new kind of museum space like this. Before the weekend, the students read studies on community engagement and learning interaction design, along with front-end evaluation and other research that informed the creation of Q?rius. Upon arriving in Washington, DC, students explore the activities and programs of Q?rius and talk with its creators and managers about the impact, lessons learned, and potential. On Saturday, students take part in workshops based on the Q?Method, a creative design methodology used to make the interactive activities at the museum. The students engage in rapid prototyping and practice setting goals for collections-based inquiry learning. On the final day, students have the opportunity to engage with staff in collaborative design critique and a session to learn the art of facilitating museum experiences.","

Universal design involves creating products and spaces so that they can be used by the widest range of people possible. Universal design evolved from accessible design, a design process that addressed the needs of people with disabilities. Universal design takes into account the full range of human diversity, including physical, perceptual, and cognitive abilities, as well as different body sizes and shapes. By designing for this diversity, we can create spaces that are more functional and more user-friendly for everyone. The course explores current technologies used in universal design, assessments of physical and communication barriers of museum facilities, and cost-effective mediations and adaptations for museums.","

,"From antiquity to modern times, artists and scholars of all disciplines routinely built three-dimensional objects in order to represent complex concepts and appearances. Some rendered visible abstract formulas in geometrical forms like the movement of the stars; others schematized complex work flows like drainage systems, or the geographical conditions on Earth; still others proposed costly projects, such as the cupola of St. Peter in Rome, on the basis of a model. These models—many of which still survive in our museums—were constructed according to precise rules and regulations, as well as personal taste. The course offers a historical introduction to the significance of models and visualizations for the display of knowledge, and the manner in which they were crafted and used by artists, curators, physicians, and natural philosophers.","

,"Capitalism organizes society around individual pursuits of material gain. Capitalism seems to have won the great ideological struggle with other ways of organizing society. But there is much discontent. The Occupy Movement made clear that even Americans now care about excessive inequality, and many worry about the future in an increasingly economically divided society where access to technology richly rewards some to the exclusion of many others. Capitalism is also closely associated with what is arguably the biggest policy problem of the twenty-first century, climate change. So how can we justify capitalism? And what are feasible alternative ways of organizing society? This class begins with an assessment of the current crisis and explores a range of influential arguments for capitalism. Then we turn to socialist/communist approaches focusing on some of the more influential writings of Karl Marx. Finally, we explore the liberal egalitarianism of John Rawls. The debate about capitalism and its alternatives (and about what capitalism might learn from those) addresses the central political and social concerns of our times. This class offers an in-depth encounter with the major positions in that debate and thereby prepares students to participate in that debate in an informed way.

In addition, we critically examine opportunities for and obstacles to economic justice in the current global economy—under conditions that did not exist for any of the three classical economic systems. At all times we consider responsibilities of fairness, moral culpability, the requirements of a good life, the grounding of claims for a good life, the problem of poverty, and the ways in which economic systems materially and culturally set conditions for a productive, fair, and just life for all members of the global community.","

,"Whoever you are, wherever you live, one question we all ask is the same: What should I eat for dinner? In public health, we also ask: Why does it matter for human populations, and our planet? Our daily diet has significant personal, local, and global consequences, farm to fork. Yet junk-science is rampant, making it difficult for people to know what to eat for optimal health and wellness for their bodies, as well as our shared environment. The goal of this course is to examine what and how we eat, and why it matters.

Throughout the course, students are exposed to cutting-edge research and influential thought-leaders informing today's food conversations both in theory and in practice. Lectures, readings, activities, and online discussions are designed to challenge students to examine their belief systems about what they eat, and to think critically about their own choices in light of public health and sustainable development. Assignments allow students to analyze thoroughly their own diet and consider how their shopping and eating behaviors impact their individual health and society as a whole. At the course's conclusion, students have developed a solid scientific foundation for understanding why what we eat matters, farm to fork—and have acquired the tools and skills to make the healthiest and most sustainable food choices, people to planet. Students who have completed ENVR E-129 in the past cannot receive degree credit for NUTR E-115.","

,"Students examine evidence-based relationships between nutrition and the promotion of long-term health and wellbeing. They become familiar with food-related policy and recommendations, including the US Dietary Guidelines, FDA Food Labels, and evidence-based nutrition programs, and gain practical skills to make healthful dietary choices. Moreover, students learn health promotion strategies to help influence other people's food choices and apply these strategies to a specific modifiable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. After successful completion of this course, students are able to identify the fundamentals of a healthy eating pattern; recognize associations between dietary behaviors and non-communicable diseases and identify evidence-based dietary interventions for those diseases; understand barriers to healthful eating, including cultural, environmental, and social; utilize validated tools to encourage healthful food choices; provide practical advice to improve dietary behaviors; and become adept at accessing evidence-based resources to maintain the most up-to-date knowledge, skills, and tools to promote good nutrition.","

,"Taught in cooperation with musicians of the Harvard-affiliated Silk Road Ensemble, this course explores the social processes and ethical challenges of intercultural musical exchange, composition, and performance. With an articulated humanistic goal of creating ""unexpected connections, collaborations, and communities in pursuit of meaningful change,"" the Silk Road Project provides a rich laboratory for appraising how dimensions of difference have been conveyed through artistic performance as well as the many issues that such initiatives raise. Critical and reflexive theoretical approaches from ethnomusicology, anthropology, and performance studies, among other disciplines, are used to frame selected case studies relevant to the Silk Road Ensemble experience. Topics include the cultivation of cultural difference through the arts, the ethics of intercultural musical collaboration, the potential of social engagement to mitigate pressing social and political problems, and the role of the arts in community building. The course includes a mix of lecture, discussion of assigned readings and listening examples, and dialogue about issues with musicians from the Silk Road Ensemble who serve as interlocutors and provide insider perspectives of the ensemble's work. This course provides a rare opportunity for students to address important cultural issues in the performing arts while taking into account the perspectives of distinguished performers involved in this work.

,"This course uses hands-on media production to examine the interplay between music and technology. Using sound and video editing software (principally, Ableton Live), we explore new techniques for telling stories about music and media by composing a series of etudes. Readings, discussions, and projects focus on several significant forms and their histories, including soundscapes, mashups, montages, and DJ-style mixes. Students develop a fluency in the history of sound studies while cultivating competencies in audio and video editing, sampling and arranging, mixing and remixing, and, in framing their projects, descriptive and poetic forms of writing.","

,"Museums have the potential to be centers of gravity inviting discourse and participation from audiences around current events and the pressing issues of our time. A new wave of community minded museums is taking up the charge, to shine a light on civic unrest, racial violence, human rights issues, and beyond. Provocative and timely public programs help museums, explore new narratives, foster civic engagement, and address social change movements, while building a base of dynamic new museum goers. As America's demographics continue to change ever more quickly, it is imperative for museums to evolve to meet the needs of increasingly diverse communities. This course explores various institutions as case studies and examines the public programs and initiatives they host, using technology, public forums, artistic demonstrations, activism, live performance, collections, and talk-backs to reframe personal histories, expand interpretations, and increase tolerance in society, as catalysts of social movements.","

,"This course considers questions surrounding the role of museums in defining, displaying, and defending cultural property. For purposes of the course, cultural property is understood to include portable art objects and artifacts as well fixed monuments and sites. Through a series of case studies it examines in turn such issues as ownership, stewardship, and repatriation; looting, illicit trade, and the cultural property marketplace; and the protection of cultural property in the face both of armed conflict and peacetime economic development. It also explores the relationships between material cultural property and contemporary and historical human identities at the national, regional, and local scale, especially as these identities are portrayed in museums. Though not devoted in depth to matters of cultural property law or museum law, the course takes into account the wide range of national laws, international conventions, and treaties that pertain to cultural property. The course has a decided focus on the Mediterranean and Middle East, areas of the instructor's particular specialization, with excursions into relevant parallel cases in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.","

,"In the ancient world, a museum was a place where ideas were exchanged. Using that definition as a starting point, this course examines the intellectual life of museums beginning with concepts of collecting and cultural property in the medieval period. We look at how traders, pilgrims, and crusaders perceived objects they brought back to western Europe; how the organization of collections into taxonomic categories influenced science in the age of Enlightenment; how natural history, anthropology, and art museums contributed to the development of those subject fields; the gulf between the ""learned societies"" and the P. T. Barnums; how social changes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to the rise of large public museums; and how museums are redefining themselves today as educational, social, and cultural institutions.","
