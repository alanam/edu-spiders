,"The course imparts knowledge and skills for planning sustainability projects and developing solutions for organizations of at least 50 employees including small businesses, nonprofits, or local townships. Sustainability solutions refers to working with a client either as a member of a team or individually developing and delivering a customized sustainability action plan (SAP). Common client goals are reduction of operating costs, minimization of the environmental footprint, and improvement of environmental sustainability practices. Opportunities are identified and initiatives developed in collaboration with the client for both short and long term. Typical areas of focus include energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, supply chain management, green IT, and transportation. In support of recommended initiatives, SAPs emphasize a process to foster sustainable behavior, outline key performance indicators to measure performance, and build a sustainability capital reserve to capture cost savings for possible future investments. Deliverables for the course are a SAP and a presentation to the client stakeholders. A substantial amount of time during the semester is spent on coaching students regarding how to most effectively work with the clients to address organizational requirements, develop solutions, and present SAPs. Sustainability executives and consultants occasionally serve as guest speakers to share experiences and best practices. The case method is utilized to provide a participative and realistic forum enabling students to learn about sustainability while also developing the skills to use the knowledge gained. Whether the SAP is developed for a client by a team or an individual, the course structure enables and ensures evaluation of individual student effort through student reflections and a client satisfaction survey. Past clients have included New York City Department of Sanitation, Greater Pittsburgh YMCA, General Electric Applicances, Utah Center for Affordable Housing, and Amazon.","

,"The course provides each participant with a guided immersion in the processes of heuristic question formulation, objective research design, and implementation. Included are hypothesis testing, data collection and analysis, writing, revision, and final dissemination. Four contexts catalyze this integrative work and ensure extensive feedback. Individual meetings of each participant with the course instructor occur throughout the semester, beginning with review of the preliminary research proposal and completion of a needs assessment survey. Subsequent meetings serve to ensure research progress is on track and make full use of available experts, references, and other resources. Lectures and discussions explore challenges and opportunities in boundary delineation and other assumptions, project scoping, assessment of potential impact (and, where appropriate, procedural reviews such as the university's policy on use of human subjects), inclusion of stakeholders, and sampling design; logical consistency, lateral thinking, use and analysis of case studies; benchmarking, bet-hedging; effective writing, graphic presentation and referencing; public presentation and network establishment. Using a recurring workshop format, participants regularly present components of their work-in-progress to subgroups and to the entire class, for review and constructive input. At the semester's close, the professional community is invited to attend participants' presentations of their final research projects. This is accomplished via a class poster exhibition and/or through a web-based video archive of project presentations.","

,"Understanding the dynamics of complex ecological and environmental systems and designing policies to promote their sustainability is a formidable challenge. Both the practitioner and policymaker must be able to evaluate scientific research, recognizing fundamental pitfalls in research design and data interpretation. Moreover, most important environmental problems involve interactions among variables as dynamic systems, so forecasting the impacts of potential environmental changes or policy interventions is critical. To develop these skills, students conduct practical exercises illustrating a range of modeling techniques, including statistical analysis of ecological and environmental data, and system dynamics modeling. Computer simulation modeling ranges across diverse issues in sustainability science, such as climate change, human population dynamics, population viability analysis of endangered species, and economic appraisal of projects that have an impact on natural resources. The course also focuses on developing skills in scientific writing, critiquing primary research literature, and communicating about environmental science. Quantitative techniques are taught at an introductory level; some data analysis and simulation modeling is conducted using Excel spreadsheets. Online students are invited to attend sustainability and environmental management campus events scheduled around the Monday section on stakeholder negotiation.","

,"Astrobiology, the subject of this course, is a new discipline born out of the convergence of all scientific inquiry currently under way on the question of the origin and development of life here on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the Universe. Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life in our solar system. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And astronomers have been recently successful in searching for planets around other stars. Searches for extra-solar planets are currently under way and are leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.","

Communities are created through virtual interactions, despite geographic dispersion, and trends can take hold globally in an instant. Yet, the rise of mass media creates questions and problems as well as possibilities: What happens to privacy in an era where so much is publicized and posted? What are the social consequences of recording so much of life, and how does the ubiquity of social media transform interpersonal interaction? What new forms of control and censorship might these technologies engender? In this course, we examine the forms of sociality, belonging, and exclusion produced through various forms of mass and social media. We consider topics ranging from international advertising to online dating, from the Arab Spring to Gamergate, from children's programming to reality television.","

,"In 1903, W.E.B. DuBois wrote prophetically that ""the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line."" More recently, anthropologists and historians have argued that the very idea of race—the notion that human beings can be exhaustively divided into enduring groups such as whites, blacks, or Indians—was first invented in the New World, in the Americas. But what are races? Does it mean the same thing to be white in Boston as it does in Bogotá? If blackness in Alabama is rooted in assumptions about essential biological nature, does the same go for Rio de Janeiro? Is race simply an illusion, a convenient mask for political domination and economic exploitation? Can we hope to abolish the concept of race altogether, or is its grip too tenacious, its appeal to the psyche too great? This course considers episodes in the development of racial categories in Latin and North America. Our aim is to arrive at an overall sense of the nature of race in social life by comparing the logic of racial practices at different times and places in the hemisphere.","

,"This course is designed specifically for secondary school educators interested in developing their expertise as readers and teachers of literature. In this course, we consider those American poets whose themes, forms, and voices have given expression to visions of the city since 1850.  Beginning with Walt Whitman, the great poet of nineteenth-century New York, we explore the diverse and ever-changing environment of the modern city—from Chicago to London, from San Francisco to Detroit—through the eyes of such poets as Carl Sandburg, Emma Lazarus, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, Marianne Moore, Frank OHara, Gwendolyn Brooks, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Hayden, and Robert Pinsky, as well as contemporary hip hop and spoken word artists.  Deep study of the poems and poets on our syllabus provides an opportunity to develop expertise as classroom educators. As we develop and practice advanced strategies for studying American poetry ourselves, we also gain rich new resources for the classroom. This course introduces content and techniques intended to help educators teach their students how to read texts of increasing complexity. The course meets relevant educational standards for grades 6-12, including the Common Core State Standards.","

,"One might reasonably conclude that all narrators in fiction or in life are to some extent fallible or unreliable. Our focus specifically engages the question of how selected authors further their artistic purposes by creating narrators who subtly or blatantly confuse appearance and reality, fancy and fact, opportunism and beneficence, opacity and insight. In the process, we address the implications and relevance of such labels as hero, lunatic, scoundrel. Our consideration of narrative strategies leads to an exploration of the manner in which these fictions can illuminate one another and, in the process, deepen our understanding of literature, our own lives, and the lives of others.

It was originally developed by the Zofnass Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and it is currently offered by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI). A set of sixty sustainability criteria arranged in the categories of quality of life, leadership, resource allocation, natural world, and climate and risk are the core of Envision. While these criteria can be used to guide the decision making process, a third-party project verification and award program is available to recognize projects that have achieved higher levels of sustainability. Envision is a valuable resource for all the stakeholders involved in the development of infrastructure, including engineers, owners, policy makers, community groups, and construction workers. Professionals trained in the use of Envision can be credentialed by ISI as Envision sustainability professionals. The course delves into the methodology and criteria of Envision, using them as a foundation for exploring the technical and organizational dimensions of sustainable infrastructure design. It covers how the tool offers a guide through the various phases of a project, from the first planning steps developing the project brief and purpose, to avoiding traps and vulnerabilities in the long term. The interdependencies between design decisions, technical considerations, and the impacts on the adjacent communities and natural environment are discussed. Experts from the industry and academia are invited to cover key points of the Envision methodology such as the principles of life cycle analysis and methods for meaningful engagement with members of the public and other stakeholder groups.

,"Zero energy buildings, also known as net zero energy buildings are buildings (or a community of buildings) which produce with on-site renewables the same amount of energy as they consume, on an annual basis. Typically, a zero energy building consists of a highly-efficient building with rooftop, or site mounted, photovoltaic system. Zero energy is very scalable from single family homes to large commercial buildings to districts or communities of buildings. Once the realm of the most ambitious building owners willing to take significant financial risks, experience, technology, and financing mechanisms have begun to evolve to the point where a zero energy building can cost less to own and operate than a traditional code building. Indeed, Massachusetts is now beginning to see the emergence of spec-built zero energy homes, targeted at the affordable, low-income housing market. Other emerging trends include Executive Order 13514, which requires all new federal buildings to be designed to be zero energy by 2030, as well as various state and municipal initiatives. In the next few decades, it's possible that a large portion of new construction could be zero energy, either by code or by economics. This course provides a comprehensive exploration of zero energy buildings including building energy dynamics and renewable system fundamentals; energy economics, energy budgets, and site and source energy; relevant policy, codes, financing, and incentive structures; state of practice in zero energy design and construction, for both residential scale and commercial/institutional scale; case studies to demonstrate feasibility, key concepts, and lessons learned; the benefits and challenges zero energy imposes on the energy grid; the value zero energy can have in advancing security and resilience.","

,"In recent years, high performance green buildings have gone from fringe to main stream. Organizations and municipalities around the world have started requiring elements of green building on new construction and major renovations, green materials and equipment are abundant in the marketplace, energy disclosure ordinances are being adopted, and green building rating systems and standards are becoming part of the popular vernacular. Commitments made at COP 21 in Paris ensure this trend will continue over the next decade or more. We still have a long way to go and there is lots of room for improvement in the way we design, build, and operate our buildings, but there is definite movement in the right direction. While there is increasing support for green building, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions receive the bulk of the attention. There are many reasons for this: energy savings are relatively straightforward to quantify and verify and are easily translated into financial savings and returns on investment while global climate change is disproportionately affected by the built environment. Energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions are extremely important, but green building is an umbrella term that incorporates best practice and aspirational building design, construction, and operations strategies that are good for both the planet and people. This course exclusively looks at the impact of the built environment on people and demonstrates how green buildings can improve occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. It attempts to answer two questions: What makes a building healthy, comfortable, and productive for its occupants? How can we influence design, construction, and operations to ensure healthy, comfortable, and productive buildings? Students learn about occupants' interaction with light, color, sound, temperature and humidity, toxins and contaminants, plants and nature, and food and water. We review the most recent research in these areas and identify where additional research is needed. We also go through relevant green building standards, codes, and rating systems and discuss their applicability, strengths, and weaknesses. Students are introduced to design principles and tools for the design of healthy, comfortable, and productive facilities. Case studies demonstrate strategies to improve the occupant experience in office buildings, hospitals, schools, and residential buildings. Students leave the class with an understanding of these complex issues and are able to comfortably discuss setting goals and evaluating performance related to the occupant experience.","

War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead."" This course explores this powerful and contradictory phenomenon through the intimate accounts of those who, like O'Brien, experienced it first hand, from the Civil War through twenty-first century conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We find common threads through these accounts—compelling tales of fear and camaraderie, horror and honor delivered even as their authors worry that, as Walt Whitman put it, ""the real war will never get in the books."" We explore how war memoirs have changed, too, both as the nature of war has changed and as the nature of those who fight has changed. In addition to reading texts by men and women, volunteers and conscripts, generals and privates, we also meet war memoirists in person.","

,"When does science go too far? What are (or should be) its limitations? The scientist in literature is often represented as mad because of his willingness to go to any length to advance the cause of science—and never more so than when experiments have unintended consequences or escape the scientist's control. This fear of science and the scientist becomes a serious literary preoccupation during the nineteenth century, when experiments in electricity, reanimation, chemistry, surgery, vivisection, the use of new technologies, and the implications of Darwinism were being widely discussed and their morality questioned. With the birth of the nuclear age in the twentieth century, public anxiety about science and its uses only intensified. This course examines five works that dramatize the dilemma of the scientist when confronting the monstrosities he creates or those over which science appears to be powerless: Mary Shelley's ","

This course begins with the poetry of the American Civil War and the series of major events and social movements that followed it—including Reconstruction, the Jim Crow Era, and Manifest Destiny, to name just a few. Encountering such poets as Herman Melville, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Edward Arlington Robinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, Emma Lazarus and W.E.B. DuBois, we examine the language of patriotism, pride, violence, loss, and memory inspired by the nation's greatest conflict. As we enter the twentieth century, we encounter modernism, a movement that spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and whose poetry marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms. We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens.

,"This course focuses on the poetry of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, two influential and iconic American poets of the nineteenth century. First, we encounter Walt Whitman, a quintessentially American writer whose work continues to bear heavily upon the American poetic tradition. We explore Whitman's relationship to the city, the self, and the body through his life and poetry. Then, we turn to Emily Dickinson, one of America's most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime. Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we consider a number of Dickinson's poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with nature, art, the self, and darkness. We travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886.

,"In this course we read several landmark novels and examples of short fiction. We begin at a time in which many writers left for Europe to leave behind a country they considered provincial while others immigrated to the United States as a refuge. We examine how these continued exchanges across the Atlantic and the experiences of the World Wars and the Holocaust affected and reshaped the rich American novelistic traditions. Proceeding largely in chronological order, the sequence of readings is divided thematically. The readings cluster around the way in which traditional American settings and literary forms interact with and adapt to national and transatlantic historical change. These changes are readily reflected in the novels of immigration, the Lost Generation, and the World Wars, but they also make themselves felt subtly in the way American writers think about the suburb, a direct result of World War II, negotiate the relationship between individualism and the shaping influence of family legacies, and try to grapple with the lasting effects of slavery.","

,"This course explores the debate about the minimum wage from all points of view. What is the history of the minimum wage in the US? Who is affected? Does the minimum wage reduce employment of low wage workers, as some argue? Does it have a significant impact on their incomes? Should the federal government raise the minimum wage? Abolish it? Leave it to the states? Why do some firms pay entry-level workers more than the minimum wage while other firms in the same industry do not? Students review the arguments and evidence on the minimum wage, investigate what economists have learned about its impact, understand why firms might choose to pay more than the minimum wage, review and evaluate current proposals to raise the minimum wage, and explore some of the philosophical and ethical issues raised about labor markets, income inequality, and low income workers","

It is important to remember that Shakespeare's verse dramas were written to be performed and that only when they are approached this way—as playable, theatrical texts—do they have their maximum impact. Through text analysis, scene study, vocal work, and acting exercises we attempt to find, not only the meaning, but the music and theatrical power of Shakespeare's words. We spend a great deal of class time discussing blank verse and the different techniques for speaking it out loud and work to develop the end-of-line breath support needed to perform this language. We also study such topics as scansion, phrasing, word emphasis, antithesis, and imagery.","

In this course, we explore the impact new technology is having on how firms connect to their customers, how they compete with incumbent and new firms in their product market, and what this means for workers and outcomes in labor markets. How many workers and firms are affected? Are there limits to what types/how many workers and firms are likely to be affected? What can we learn from Hollywood? We look at previous historical examples of this type of organization—including the movie and TV industry which has long had a disaggregated approach to producing its product and hiring workers. We examine Uber, AirBnb, and similar firms. How was their rise facilitated by new technology? What do they provide their customer that was not previously available? How is this changing competition?  What is the nature of this new employment relationship with workers? Are the employees independent contractors, or something in between? To what extent does this affect labor market outcomes including flexibility and worker autonomy, but also worker income, non-wage benefits such as health insurance, and income security? To what extent do these new relationships—between customer and firm and between firm and worker—require new types of government oversight or regulation (if any)?","

Course topics include a critical analysis of the continuing viability of cities in the context of current economic and demographic dynamics, fiscal stress, governance, economic development, poverty and race, drugs, homelessness, federal urban policy, and survival strategies for declining cities. The course considers economic development, social equity, and job growth in the context of metropolitan regions, and addresses federal, state, and local government strategies for expanding community economic development and affordable housing opportunities. Of special concern is the continuing spatial and racial isolation and concentration of low-income populations, especially minority populations, residing in urban communities including older, industrial cities. The course examines how market forces and pressures affect the availability of affordable housing, exacerbate the impacts of gentrification, and inhibit the availability of capital for affordable housing and economic development. It also examines how issues around growing housing affordability problems, the changing structure of capital markets, the reduction of low-skilled jobs in central city locations, and racial discrimination combine to limit housing and employment opportunities.","

When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence. The role of important constituents (commercial and investment banks, exchanges, regulators, hedge funds, government interventions) are reviewed and evaluated for both past performance and future relevance. The course addresses important current topics in both economics and public policy, such as too big to fail, moral hazard, globalization of markets, currency unions, liquidity traps, efficiency of markets, the role of credit rating agencies, shadow banking, regulation of derivatives and hedge funds, Glass-Steagall, and the Volcker Rule.","

Students also consider the role program theory plays in guiding those efforts in practice. They learn to assess the impact of these efforts and to improve programs based on those assessments. Students study the way social entrepreneurs generate and mobilize resources, negotiate partnerships with the public sector, and create and sustain organizations to support both innovation and the transition to institutionalization.  At the beginning, the course examines the reemergence of public-private partnerships in education, and the role of social entrepreneurs in that process.  Using a series of cases on social entrepreneurs and educational innovation, we discuss how program theory contributes to the success of a particular project, and examine how these projects evolve, from initial design to improving effectiveness and refining program theory, and finally to scale-up and institutionalization.

,"In this course, students use a design thinking methodology to design and develop an authentic learning product or experience. Each student prepares a product, such as a course or workshop, social learning community, website, or software application. Using rapid prototyping, students present several iterations of their designs to the class, participate in peer critiques, and continually improve their products over the semester. As instructional designers work in a team, each student contributes to, and benefits from, a class consulting bank. They use their skills to help others and to gain currency that they can exchange for help on their own projects. Students also explore additional instructional design frameworks and learning theories to improve fluency and flexible thinking in the field.","

,"How do adults learn most effectively online? The online learning environment differs from traditional on-ground approaches and relies heavily on active collaborative techniques to help learners construct knowledge and build community, but why? This course focuses on designing instruction for the unique needs of adult online learners, critically examining related learning theories, instructional design practices, and online teaching strategies. Students examine dynamics that lead to online learning success, developing an appreciation for how adult learning theory informs effective instruction. In addition, as students collaboratively develop online lessons, they utilize design thinking, a framework leveraged by many highly innovative organizations today. In this case, students learn their way into inventive instructional solutions by analyzing adult online learner traits, acquiring interviewing techniques to identify desired learning outcomes, ideating and rapidly creating prototypes, pivoting as brainstorming leads to alternative approaches, and ultimately developing effective learner-centered activities and assessment strategies. Design thinking challenges the designer to develop empathy for stakeholders—in this case, the adult learner. Given a foundation in adult online learning theory, students conduct an empathetic exploration of best practices in designing instruction and online facilitation, comparing and contrasting these approaches, as well as examining quality rubrics published by organizations such as Quality Matters and the Online Learning Consortium. This course is of particular interest to those professionals who contribute to online teaching and learning outcomes in higher education or corporate settings.","

,"Behind every good learning tool—be it a website, app, webinar, online course, workshop, or interactive museum exhibit—is the work of an instructional designer. Instructional design is a creative process that uses learning theories and frameworks, project planning, content expertise, communication, writing, and technology to architect experiences for today's learners. The best instructional designers are agile and adaptable; they can quickly synthesize unfamiliar content, evaluate new technologies, and develop learning solutions that best meet the needs of a diverse audience. In this course, students work together to produce learning experiences using today's media and technologies. The gap between theory and practice is an issue in many fields. By using a project-based approach, we work to close that gap by learning about instructional design theories and frameworks while developing a series of products; students submit a project every two weeks. This course is helpful for those professionals who work directly or indirectly to support and improve learning in their organizations, or those lifelong learners who want to better understand how to use technology to manage their own learning.","

We ascertain recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles without, however, overlooking critical differences. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes over and over again? The great meltdown happened at a time when most macroeconomists (including Nobel Prize winner Bob Lucas as well as none other than the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke) were writing about the great moderation, that is, that business cycles have vanished for all practical purposes. They, along with most of their colleagues, were dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of the global economy in which we live and work.

,"Globalization is no longer an academic theory; it is a reality that affects all of our lives. From the foods we eat to the goods we buy, the ubiquity of developing countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and former Soviet Union—those frequently referred to as emerging markets—intensifies daily. Yet beyond the well-documented commercial and cultural impacts of globalization, there are strong but less visible trends towards greater global financial and investment integration. What makes emerging financial markets different from those in the US, Europe, or Japan? What are the benefits of adding these markets to a traditional investment portfolio? How do policies shape these markets? Why invest in certain countries versus others? Within a country, which asset class should we invest in? How do hedge funds approach these markets vs. traditional investors? How has the global credit crisis that began in 2007 altered the trajectories of developing and industrialized countries? From the practical perspective of a US institutional investor, this course is geared to help answer these questions. Students develop greater abilities to analyze global macro trends and country fundamentals, master portfolio construction concepts, and implement practical investment strategies.","

,"Sustainability, whether environmental or social, is increasingly becoming a core part of the work of corporations, nonprofits,and other organizations. As a result, many people now work in roles where they must communicate about sustainability topics, whether to internal team members, management, employees, journalists, grant-makers, the public, or other stakeholders. The success of sustainability initiatives often hinges on the ability of the communicator to understand the target groups attitudes, barriers, and trigger points, and communicate persuasively on this often complex topic.  This course provides an in-depth practical study of the best practices in sustainability marketing and communication, using case studies and class assignments that reflect actual tasks students face in the workplace. A high level of engagement and discussion is expected from all students, as we tackle sometimes controversial and often complex subjects in class.","

In 2011, an estimated 79.6 percent of the US GDP was created by the services sector. Emerging economies have similarly seen explosive growth in the percentage of their workforce employed in the provision of services, as trends as offshoring and outsourcing become more prevalent. This course explores how leaders design service experiences and systems to manage employees and customers to consistently deliver exceptional and profitable services. Through case studies from a variety of industries (retail, banking, technology), and the sharing of professional experiences, students gain practical insights that can be readily applied in the workplace. In the first part of the course, we discuss operational topics, including the trade-offs involved in the service model, the customer and management systems, and the funding mechanism. We touch upon customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. The concepts of service journey, capacity, and demand management cap this section of the course. We then embark onto a series of interactive highly practical workshops designed to study design thinking, with a specific focus on the service design toolset. Students gain proficiency in human-centered approaches such as blueprinting, customer journeys, and the hear-create-deliver methodology.

Expectations for measurable progress of corporate environmental programs addressing natural resources, pollution controls, monitoring ethical supply chains, and expanded training of employees are growing globally.

However, the lack of standardized methodology and metrics has resulted in confusion within many industries, hindering progress.

,"This course is about how to develop, tailor and apply decision-making frameworks to real world strategy problems. It complements standard strategy courses in a number of important ways. Whereas standard strategy courses typically provide conceptual approaches to formulate strategies to establish sustainable competitive advantage, we focus on short- to medium-term margin improvement. The majority of the course content focuses on hands-on tools and frameworks that help strategic and marketing managers formulate strategy to obtain short-to medium term advantages rather than long term competitive advantage. In standard strategy courses a number of theoretically sound frameworks of analysis are introduced. This course builds on them but focuses on the how question: Which framework is relevant for what problem? What are the key operational steps to approach a strategy problem (such as entry into a market), and how does one tailor them to the specific company and industry situation? In standard strategy case-based courses, students typically learn to provide strategic solutions from given case information whereas a real world strategy problem often has a blank sheet as a starting point. This course addresses questions such as: How do we gather the right information to address a strategic issue, given real world informational constraints? How do we process that information for improved decision-making?","

,"Students engage in a series of in-depth, practical decision making situations in the field of real estate investment through Harvard Business School case studies. We review the methods by which real property investments are analyzed—including both financial and nonfinancial considerations. Students then step into the shoes of a first-time investor, meet the various players in the process, and weigh the risks and opportunities from the standpoint of an individual investor as well as a lender. Next, students gain experience in assessing investors' specific needs, creating financial feasibility analyses of several competing projects, and selecting the most appropriate investments. We examine operational aspects of real estate projects while grappling with coordinating a warehouse rehabilitation project, deciding how to set fair benchmark accountability standards for third-party contractors and how to align incentives—all while staying on schedule and on budget. Students gain experience in the time-honored real estate skills of diplomacy, consensus building, and good old-fashioned horse trading as they negotiate with a large tenant and, in another case study, pursue a development in an urban setting surrounded by myriad concerned (and active) community stakeholders. Students experience the real estate field from a small financial services company's viewpoint and address the perennial dilemma of whether to risk transitioning into a large institutionalized company or risk remaining a small entrepreneurial company indefinitely. Finally, students face down panic and uncertainty when the half-way completed New York City skyscraper they are responsible for building is threatened by a global financial crisis— and determine which considerations are most important and what risks are most relevant. Students should prepare for active engagement with the instructor and their peers in this fast-paced, case study driven course.","

,"At a time when society's views on personal morality, social aims, and the environment often appear to conflict with business culture and goals, this course takes a closer look at how managers make decisions in results-driven enterprises. Students explore common organizational situations involving apparent trade-offs between profit or productivity goals and more qualitative values such as loyalty, reciprocity, fairness, honesty, or altruism. The situations explored include those relevant to marketing and commerce (price gouging in a crisis, for example), firm collaborations (transparency in partnerships), negotiations (trust), international development (standards and responsibility), lay-offs/downsizing (impacts), environmental crises (prevention and recuperation), and the management of corporate culture (values and leadership).

,"Design thinking is a method of applying creativity to come up with novel solutions to tough problems. It's the process of immersing yourself in a problem space, thinking creatively around pain points and opportunity areas, then iteratively prototyping totally new solutions. Focused on listening, user empathy, whole-brain thinking, collaboration, and experimentation, design thinking can be applied within any team and in any field; from architecture and design to healthcare and product development. Everything from the Swiffer to the Apple Watch has been a result of design thinking, and the techniques and tools can also be applied to problems in the nonprofit and public sectors. This course delves into the fundamentals of this creative approach by immersing students in the doing of design thinking.

,"When disasters strike—whether natural disasters, failures of critical technology systems, disease, or terrorism—society must respond to the needs of individuals, families, and communities whose lives have been severely disrupted. Then in ensuing weeks, months, and years, an affected city or region must initiate recovery from the physical damage, social and economic disruption, and demoralization of a catastrophe. This course focuses on the management of humanitarian relief—shelter, food, medical care, and the restoration of critical public services and basic economic activity—once disaster rescues have been accomplished; and it looks at the dynamics of community recovery in the aftermath of major disasters. But these processes are not exclusively post-disaster; society must take steps in advance to be prepared to provide relief rapidly and make recovery as speedy and complete as possible. Through intensive study of cases of actual disasters and of conceptual frameworks about relief and recovery, the course looks at examples in the United States and in other countries and considers the provision and coordination of international aid in disaster settings.","

Today not only traditional emergency responders (police, firefighters, and emergency medical teams) must be ready for crises, but also private and nonprofit organizations, as well as a wider spectrum of public sector responders (for example, public health, transportation, and public works). Through study of cases of a range of actual crises and of conceptual frameworks for understanding the dynamics of crises, this course takes a managerial perspective on crisis management and emergency preparedness. It focuses both on what responders must do during the critical period of crisis response and on how organizations can prepare themselves for high performance in these situations. It examines how individuals and groups make decisions in crises, identifies the skills and management systems crises demand, considers the differences between managing routine emergencies and crises, and asks how organizations can effectively prepare for crises in advance.","

First, we turn back the clock to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and investigate what it took to deliver drugs and save lives. By doing so, we develop a diverse toolkit that introduces students to approaches from history, anthropology, public health, law, and medicine. The goal is to understand illness as both something that happens in the body and something that happens in society. With these approaches in our toolbox, we turn our attention to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the subsequent cholera epidemic. We ask hard questions about the unintended consequences of good intentions and consider the challenges of providing care in the poorest parts of the world. Finally, we turn to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which the World Health Organization called ""the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times."" We read about the response from Partners in Health and Last Mile Health and see what happened when modern medicine met this deadly illness—only to ask why it never had before.

This course explores the cultural dimensions of social class in the US from an ethnographic perspective, focusing on the everyday lives and cultures of ordinary Americans. We consider questions such as the following: what is it like to be a working class person in a society heavily invested in ideas of individual advancement and meritocracy? How do professionals (the upper middle class) define themselves and how do they view those above and below them in the class structure? How does social class shape people's values, political views, and tastes? How are class boundaries created and maintained? The course readings are drawn mainly from anthropology and sociology.","

,"Globalization, increasing transparency in business operations, and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations. Societal and business imperatives are not only considered compatible, they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize, and engage based on mutual interests and generally place greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the science of sales. Whether you are selling a product, an intervention, or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today's dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business, or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention, and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a silver bullet and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences. Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practices, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders, and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit citizenship, and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include cause-related marketing and cause branding, nonprofit branding, and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.","

How have museums evolved from the transformation of the Louvre Palace into a public museum during the French Revolution, to the spectacular museum architecture found around the world today? Through a series of case studies of international museums, dating primarily from the past seventy-five years, we examine each museum's history, collections, and mission in relation to its architecture. Finally, we look at the process for developing an architectural feasibility study for the creation, renovation, or expansion of a museum.","

,"This course gives museum administrators and educators new tools for making museums agents of change in the world. Using the pre-texts model, an artist/educator training program that combines high-order literacy, innovation, and citizenship, the course encourages students to develop hands-on, art-making activities that turn museum collections into resources for exploring difficult texts. Art works are studied and used to create visual and performative interpretations of challenging written material that people would otherwise not access. In this way, museums play a central role in developing good readers and engaged viewers of art. Museum staff expand their role beyond traditional modes of providing outreach to engage their visitors with the texts through art and vice-versa, making for a deeper and more meaningful learning experience in the museum setting. In this active learning weekend, students hear lectures, make their own art, and experience the pre-texts that their museum visitors might use. They are challenged to step outside of the box to think creatively about how their museum or a museum might work with its community in new ways that develop an appreciation for art and citizenship.","

,"Museums are changing. Many are experimenting with shifting old models of exhibit-based, one-way communication in favor of engagement strategies that involve participation and meaningful involvement of nontraditional audiences. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History has created a new physical space and initiative called Q?rius that has been experimenting with creative audience interaction. Opened in 2013, educators use the space to prototype, test, refine, and deploy many kinds of interactive activities and programs from games to collections-based labs and digital fieldbooks to experimental scientist programs. At the heart of the initiative is an active group of youth from local communities underrepresented in science who act as activity advisors and visitor facilitators in the space. In this course, the educators who created and run Q?rius lead students in activities that allow them to experience the process of developing a new kind of museum space like this. Before the weekend, the students read studies on community engagement and learning interaction design, along with front-end evaluation and other research that informed the creation of Q?rius. Upon arriving in Washington, DC, students explore the activities and programs of Q?rius and talk with its creators and managers about the impact, lessons learned, and potential. On Saturday, students take part in workshops based on the Q?Method, a creative design methodology used to make the interactive activities at the museum. The students engage in rapid prototyping and practice setting goals for collections-based inquiry learning. On the final day, students have the opportunity to engage with staff in collaborative design critique and a session to learn the art of facilitating museum experiences.","

Universal design takes into account the full range of human diversity, including physical, perceptual, and cognitive abilities, as well as different body sizes and shapes. By designing for this diversity, we can create spaces that are more functional and more user-friendly for everyone.

Some rendered visible abstract formulas in geometrical forms like the movement of the stars; others schematized complex work flows like drainage systems, or the geographical conditions on Earth; still others proposed costly projects, such as the cupola of St. Peter in Rome, on the basis of a model. These models—many of which still survive in our museums—were constructed according to precise rules and regulations, as well as personal taste.

,"Capitalism organizes society around individual pursuits of material gain. Capitalism seems to have won the great ideological struggle with other ways of organizing society. But there is much discontent. The Occupy Movement made clear that even Americans now care about excessive inequality, and many worry about the future in an increasingly economically divided society where access to technology richly rewards some to the exclusion of many others. Capitalism is also closely associated with what is arguably the biggest policy problem of the twenty-first century, climate change. So how can we justify capitalism? And what are feasible alternative ways of organizing society? This class begins with an assessment of the current crisis and explores a range of influential arguments for capitalism. Then we turn to socialist/communist approaches focusing on some of the more influential writings of Karl Marx. Finally, we explore the liberal egalitarianism of John Rawls. The debate about capitalism and its alternatives (and about what capitalism might learn from those) addresses the central political and social concerns of our times. This class offers an in-depth encounter with the major positions in that debate and thereby prepares students to participate in that debate in an informed way. While the first three lectures explore the current predicament and focus on social-scientific readings, the methodological outlook of the class is philosophical.

Through the selection of readings we think critically about the prospects for economic justice introduced by each system. The main questions focus on what features an economic system and a society ought to have in order to be economically just, and what sorts of claims the different classical economic systems advance in the name of economic justice. In addition, we critically examine opportunities for and obstacles to economic justice in the current global economy—under conditions that did not exist for any of the three classical economic systems. At all times we consider responsibilities of fairness, moral culpability, the requirements of a good life, the grounding of claims for a good life, the problem of poverty, and the ways in which economic systems materially and culturally set conditions for a productive, fair, and just life for all members of the global community.","

From Superman's embrace of truth, justice, and the American way to Wonder Woman's efforts at promoting peace rather than war, from Spider-Man's personal struggles at balancing his romantic life with his crime fighting exploits to the X-Men's social struggles with combating prejudice and antagonism, the world has turned its attention to these colorful and larger-than-life narratives, which first emerged in comic books and radio shows but now are also widely found in film, television, and video games. This course leverages the enthusiasm over superheroes to introduce students to core areas of philosophy—metaphysics and epistemology, social and political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of mind, and more.

Yet junk-science is rampant, making it difficult for people to know what to eat for optimal health and wellness for their bodies, as well as our shared environment. The goal of this course is to examine what and how we eat, and why it matters. The course is taught using a four-quadrant nutritional ecology framework that comprises environment, economy, society, and health. The course covers topics ranging from understanding different production systems, ancient and modern, to identifying critical problems related to how we grow and consume food, chronic disease to climate change. We also examine different paradigms and approaches for generating healthy and sustainable solutions. Throughout the course, students are exposed to cutting-edge research and influential thought-leaders informing today's food conversations both in theory and in practice. Lectures, readings, activities, and online discussions are designed to challenge students to examine their belief systems about what they eat, and to think critically about their own choices in light of public health and sustainable development. Assignments allow students to analyze thoroughly their own diet and consider how their shopping and eating behaviors impact their individual health and society as a whole. At the course's conclusion, students have developed a solid scientific foundation for understanding why what we eat matters, farm to fork—and have acquired the tools and skills to make the healthiest and most sustainable food choices, people to planet. Students who have completed ENVR E-129 in the past cannot receive degree credit for NUTR E-115.","

,"Students examine evidence-based relationships between nutrition and the promotion of long-term health and wellbeing. They become familiar with food-related policy and recommendations, including the US Dietary Guidelines, FDA Food Labels, and evidence-based nutrition programs, and gain practical skills to make healthful dietary choices. Moreover, students learn health promotion strategies to help influence other people's food choices and apply these strategies to a specific modifiable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. After successful completion of this course, students are able to identify the fundamentals of a healthy eating pattern; recognize associations between dietary behaviors and non-communicable diseases and identify evidence-based dietary interventions for those diseases; understand barriers to healthful eating, including cultural, environmental, and social; utilize validated tools to encourage healthful food choices; provide practical advice to improve dietary behaviors; and become adept at accessing evidence-based resources to maintain the most up-to-date knowledge, skills, and tools to promote good nutrition.","

For purposes of the course, cultural property is understood to include portable art objects and artifacts as well fixed monuments and sites. Through a series of case studies it examines in turn such issues as ownership, stewardship, and repatriation; looting, illicit trade, and the cultural property marketplace; and the protection of cultural property in the face both of armed conflict and peacetime economic development. It also explores the relationships between material cultural property and contemporary and historical human identities at the national, regional, and local scale, especially as these identities are portrayed in museums. Though not devoted in depth to matters of cultural property law or museum law, the course takes into account the wide range of national laws, international conventions, and treaties that pertain to cultural property. The course has a decided focus on the Mediterranean and Middle East, areas of the instructor's particular specialization, with excursions into relevant parallel cases in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.","

Although we are primarily learning about intimate (romantic) relationships, we also discuss friendships, as well as the places where these two kinds of relationships intersect, and the ways in which they interact. Other kinds of close relationships (family and work relationships, for example) are integrated into the course, and although they are extremely valuable relationships in their own right, they are addressed secondarily to romantic relationships and friendships for the purposes of this course. Examples of topics include the biological bases of attraction and love, relationship formation and dissolution, relational interaction patterns, relationship satisfaction, and the social context of relationships (the influence of others). Students have an opportunity to explore relationships through readings in the popular press, but ultimately a scholarly, critical examination of the scientific literature serves as the foundation of our learning throughout the course. Students find that the literature contains unexpected findings that can change the way they look at relationships, both from academic and applied, real-life perspectives.","

,"The scientific study of sleep is an area of research that is both highly diverse and among the most interdisciplinary and unifying of topics in psychology and neuroscience. In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness.

,"Success in today's software marketplace requires an excellent user experience (UX). That's why all developers, architects, and managers today need to understand the basic principles of UX, even if it's not their primary job. In this course, we take an in-depth look at the foundations of an excellent UX in a platform-agnostic manner. We learn to ask and then answer the vital questions that everyone involved in software needs to consider when making every design decision; we learn to start with the user, not the toolkit. Who are our users and how do we represent them? What problems are these particular users trying to solve, and what would they consider the characteristics of a good solution? How should the user interaction flow, and how can we represent that with stories? How can we prototype and test different designs? How can we create programs to learn what users really do, instead of what they can remember doing or are willing to admit to doing? How can we measure how well we've succeeded? Rather than getting into the implementation of such elements, we focus on how one decides what to implement, and why, in order to make the user happier and more productive. For example, the web and other channels contain an enormous amount of information about how to program a color gradient or an animation. There is almost zero discussion anywhere about when to use a color gradient or animation and when not to, or why you should use them in this situation but not in that one. This course aims to correct that imbalance. Useful design tools, such as the Balsamiq mock-up editor, are discussed as they bear on specific covered topics.

,"Microbes have developed molecular mechanisms—morphological and anatomical features that allow them to survive in a wide range of habitats. Biochemical and physiological evolution in response to environmental conditions gave rise to an incredible diversity of adaptive solutions. Synthetic biologists take advantage of this diversity to explore biological solutions to problems related to alternative sources of energy and food. Other uses include the detection, processing, and recycling of pollutants as well as new applications for the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases. This course covers a series of topics including a comparison of catabolism in aerobic and anaerobic microbes, the contribution of microbes in the recycling of nutrients within an ecosystem, the role and organization of bacterial communities, and the potential of engineering microbes for therapeutic and environmental purposes.","

,"Investigations on the neural basis of emotion and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders synergistically inform each other, and in recent years have led to a leap in our understanding of emotion processing in normal and pathological conditions. In this course, a working definition of emotion from a biological point of view serves as background to explore brain circuits involved in aspects of emotional processing and their integration with decision making and goal-directed behavior. Neural networks linking the cingulate gyrus, insula, and ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortices, hippocampus and subcortical regions such as the amygdala, 'limbic' thalamus, and ventral striatum are discussed in light of their relevance to emotion processing and psychiatric disorders. Emerging concepts are the key role of biological value in emotion processing and the relationship between emotion and memory. Within this context, we discuss current knowledge on the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, with particular emphasis on clinical domains such as anxiety, psychosis, depression, autism spectrum disorders, and antisocial personality disorder. Finally, current knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and psychiatric disorders is placed in the context of social interactions, focusing in particular on the intersection between justice and psychiatry.","

,"Gene therapy and gene editing has the potential to cure a variety of genetic and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the vast number of academic and biotechnology labs pursuing research in this field. But several hurdles remain before gene therapy and gene editing can be accepted as a standard of care in personalized medicine. This course provides a survey of the progress made in the field from a primarily historical perspective, starting with initial attempts at mammalian gene transfer (leading to the advent of the transgenic mouse), through the first successful FDA-approved stem cell gene therapy trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (the bubble boy disease), and into the recent advances made in targeted gene editing using tools like CRISPR/Cas RNA-guided endonucleases. The course consists of a series of case studies that outline several of the outstanding real-life applications of genetic modification and gene therapy, with a focus on gene therapy for blood disorders. The course material prepares students to grapple with the following essential questions: How would you introduce a genetic modification in people? How would you evaluate whether your gene therapy worked?  What potential concerns can you think of when doing gene therapy in people? Because gene therapy occurs at the intersection of several biological disciplines, students should have a prior mastery of concepts in basic cell and molecular biology.","

,"In order to replicate and propagate, viruses must contend with an onslaught of immune responses at both the intracellular and organismal level. Evolutionarily, this leads to an arms race between viruses and the immune system, as each evolves mechanisms to overcome the other. This course provides an introduction to several viruses that cause human disease and the immune responses that they evade or succumb to. The course is organized in two sections: first, introduction of the immune responses most relevant for viral infection (including antibodies, T cells, natural killer cells, and intracellular nucleic acid sensors); and second, discussion of viruses famous for their impact on society and human health (including HIV, Ebola, and herpesviruses, among others). Each virus is explored in the context of its replication, mechanisms of transmission, and interaction with the immune system. We conclude with presentations led by graduate-credit students, which may extend to viruses beyond those previously examined in the course and to specialized topics, such as applications of viruses in biotechnology and therapeutics. Graduate students also participate in discussions of primary scientific literature related to lecture topics throughout the course.

How can you turn a wobbly idea into one that works? We then consider character—who does the story belong to? How do their desires, problems, and drives give the story its essential energy? Then we turn to story development and structure, the primary work of the course: how do you keep an idea alive for two-hundred pages, or two hours? What elements help a story build energy and momentum, and deliver us to a satisfying close?

The course covers root finding, solving systems of linear equations, interpolation, least squares, numerical integration and differentiation, and solving systems of differential equations. Students may have learned some techniques in calculus to approximate an area with a Riemann integral or to approximate a function with a Taylor Series. We review these techniques, and study variants that converge much faster, and are thus better suited for calculators and computers. Class work involves experimenting with different algorithms. Programming is done in MATLAB, an interactive system for exploring mathematical problems.","

,"The explosion of social media and the computerization of every aspect of social and economic activity resulted in creation of large volumes of mostly unstructured data: web logs, videos, speech recordings, photographs, e-mails, Tweets, and similar data. In a parallel development, computers keep getting ever more powerful and storage ever cheaper. Today, we have the ability to reliably and cheaply store huge volumes of data, efficiently analyze them, and extract business and socially relevant information. The key objective of this course is to familiarize the students with key information technologies used in manipulating, storing, and analyzing big data. We look at the basic tools for statistical analysis, R and Python, and some key methods of machine learning. We review MapReduce techniques for parallel processing, Hadoop, an open source framework for running MapReduce on Internet scale problems and HDFS, Hadoop's Distributed File System. We spend considerable time mastering Spark which emerged as the most important big data processing framework. We examine Spark streaming which allows analysis of data in flight—that is, near real time. We touch on tools that provide SQL-like access to unstructured data like Hive. We analyze so-called NoSQL storage solutions exemplified by Cassandra for their critical features: speed of reads and writes, and ability to scale to extreme volumes. We examine memory resident databases (VoltDB, SciDB) and graph databases (Ne4J). Students gain the ability to initiate and design highly scalable systems that can accept, store, and analyze large volumes of unstructured data in batch mode and/or real time. Most lectures are presented using Java examples. Some lectures use Python and R.","

,"One of the broad goals of data science is examining raw data with the purpose of identifying its structure and trends, and of deriving conclusions and hypotheses from it. In the modern world awash with data, data analytics is more important than ever to fields ranging from biomedical research, space and weather science, finance, business operations and production, to marketing and social media applications. This course introduces various statistical learning methods and their applications. The R programming language, a very popular and powerful platform for scientific and statistical analysis and visualization, is introduced and used throughout the course. We discuss the fundamentals of statistical testing and learning, and cover topics of linear and non-linear regression, clustering and classification, support vector machines, and decision trees. The datasets used in the examples are drawn from diverse domains such as finance, genomics, and customer sales and survey data.","

,"Living things encode their genetic code in DNA, and use this information to regulate life processes. Bioinformatics is the study of living organisms viewed as information processors. We study algorithms for problems such as gene finding, sequence alignment, motif finding, construction of phylogenetic trees, and structure prediction. While students can find implementations of many of these algorithms, a study of the algorithms leads to a better understanding of the assumptions and limitations of existing algorithms, and gives students the background to evaluate new ones. We explore some important biological problems, discuss mathematical models, and look at computer algorithms to solve these problems. Most of the interesting problems are intractable, so we look at heuristics.","

,"Paleolithic archaeology documents the origins and diversification of human behavior over the last 3.5 million years, data that when combined with fossil evidence of early hominins yields powerful evidence for understanding the history and evolutionary success of Homo sapiens. This course begins with human cultural origins that began millions of years ago in Africa, examines key themes such as the origins of tool-making, the diversification of our diet to include hunting, the control of fire, the expansion to new continents, and the ancient history of the human legacy of having an impact on environments and ecological systems, leading to the extinction of a suite of large mammals that included other hominins such as the Neanderthals. Students learn to make their own stone tools, and have frequent access to Paleolithic artifacts housed at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, including those made by Homo erectus from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and others from Eurasia made by Neanderthals and some of the earliest modern humans.","

,"This introductory course explores the ancient cultures of North America. Historical accounts of Native American communities by Europeans describe only a fraction of the total complexity of indigenous North American cultures, which extend back well over 12,000 years. Archaeology is the only tool we have for understanding the rich and varied development of prehistoric cultures on this environmentally diverse continent. We begin with an introduction to archaeology, what information it can and cannot provide and how it operates, followed by an examination of the development of prehistoric North American cultures in different areas.","

,"""We have to remember that what we observe is not nature herself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning,"" said Werner Heisenberg. We live in a global society that has committed through international agreements to protecting nature and its biodiversity, but we rarely stop to think about what defines nature; who has the power to define it, own it, or access it; and how culture informs how we understand nature and live with it. In this course, we examine central cultural and sociopolitical trends and concerns regarding the interactions between nature and society. We explore multiple ways of understanding nature in diverse societies, examine nature as a resource for exploitation, as an asset to be protected and managed, and as a natural-cultural construct—in order to understand a wide range of meanings and practices that comprise human-nature dynamics. This course material engages predominantly with social and environmental anthropology literature and it often intersects with environmental history, social studies of science, and sociology.","
