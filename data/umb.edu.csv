One important question concerns the ways in which children are fundamentally different learners and thinkers from adults and the ways in which they are fundamentally similar.CRCRTH 652L and PSYCH 552L are the same course.,Conceptual Change and Learning,University of Massachusetts Boston,www.umb.edu,,PSYCH   552L

,"The classical and medieval bestiary was an encyclopedic account of species, their attributes, and in medieval Bestiarum vocabulum, their moral meaning in God's book of the world. Animal Studies began in opposition to allegorical readings as such (including anthropomorphized and anthropocentric renderings of the animal) as a differential perspective on the self-other relation. Today, however, with the Posthuman Turn, Animal Studies connects speculative philosophies such as Object-Oriented Ontology with older forms of speculative thought, and queries the Anthropocene and its limits (as in Thing Theory), at the same time that it opens a return to a spiritually-infused understanding of the world in the Spinozan sense.

Why does literature uses its imaginative power its ability to move beyond reality & to envision figures that are non-human, abnormal, or uncivilized and are disturbing, disruptive, or horrific in form? If we examine these figures closely, one of the things that makes them both very human and very monstrous is their imaginative excess: they often have an imagination that is out of control, overly-rebellious or engaged in too-powerful thinking.

Mechanisms through which these factors are hypothesized to influence health, such as stress and access to health resources and constraints, will be discussed, as well as the ways in which these ",Social Determinants of Health and Health Disparities,University of Massachusetts Boston,www.umb.edu,3/3,ANTH   358
